<h2 id="team-understanding-of-the-digital-transformation">Team understanding of the ‚Äúdigital transformation‚Äù</h2>

<p>IT is now used to deliver services to Canadians.
If IT fails, business fails and vice versa.
The use of technology is no longer ‚Äúan IT problem‚Äù as it has real repercussions to citizens.
IT can no longer be seen as a company within another company (or an outside supplier), it has shared accountability with the organization‚Äôs mandate and is a strategic asset.</p>

<p>Current IT processes and governance methods are risky and costly, which translates into long time to deliver or change applications, devices and support.
Recovering from incidents is hard and errors resulting from changes are frequent.
We must reduce risks associated with IT and continuously improve in all of its areas.</p>

<p>That is <strong>Digital Transformation</strong>.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs an ongoing venture due to the rapid pace of change in the IT world.
It has no end date.
It never ends.</p>
