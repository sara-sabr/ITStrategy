I"ú<p>This year has been an exciting time for Strategy, Architecture and Business Relationships (SABR) within Innovation, Information and Technology Branch (IITB) from Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC).</p>

<p>Denis Skinner came to ESDC in June of 2018, who is presently the Director General of Strategy, Enterprise Architecture, and Business Relations within IITB.
Upon his arrival two new teams were created: IT Strategy (yours truly) and IT Research.
The challenge issued to these newly created teams was to help modernize a large impactful organization in the age of the notorious, and perhaps inappropriately named, ‚ÄúDigital Transformations‚Äù.</p>
