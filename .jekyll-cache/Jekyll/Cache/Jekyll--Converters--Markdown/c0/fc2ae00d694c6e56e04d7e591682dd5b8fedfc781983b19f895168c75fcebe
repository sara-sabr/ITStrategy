<h3 id="gc-wide">GC Wide</h3>

<p>Building on the <a href="it-picture-medium-term.html">Medium Term IT Picture - 2025</a>, the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-operations-strategic-plan-2018-2022.html#ToC15">Digital Operations Strategic Plan: 2018-2022 Timeline</a> and the <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32603">Policy on Service and Digital</a>, digital delivery of services and benefits from the GC are automated and integrated in the lives of Canadians.
Most Canadians use a trusted digital identity to get their services directly from the GC or with many partners that have integrated GC services into their offerings.</p>

<p>Departments and agencies of the GC are agile, modern, open and high performing organizations.
Data, information and code is shared and collaboration both internally and externally is the norm for all types of work.</p>

<p>ESDC is a leader in the ‚Äúnew‚Äù digital GC and influences other organizations to create a learning culture, be agile and automate where possible.
BDM has delivered a consolidated benefits platform that is aligned with the wider GC ‚ÄúGovernment as a service‚Äù model.</p>

<h3 id="it-within-esdc">IT within ESDC</h3>

<p>The ESDC IT Strategy continuous improvement <a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-culture-transform">transformation</a> has continued (See <a href="it-picture-medium-term.html">Medium Term IT Picture - 2025</a>) to improve the capabilities and follow recommendations from the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) and the annual <a href="https://cloud.google.com/devops/">State of DevOps Report</a>.</p>

<p>IT delivery is fast, reliable and secure for applications (software delivery, operations) and for infrastructure (user devices, services, networks).
The goal is still to continuously increase frequency of delivery while reducing the lead time, the time to restore service when an incident occurs and the rate of failure.</p>
