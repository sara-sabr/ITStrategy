I"Ì<p>Welcome to our living workspace! In fact, this is the automatically generated website based on the content living in our actual <a href="https://github.com/sara-sabr/ITStrategy">workspace</a>!</p>

<p>As per the notice that can be found throughout our site, the content you will find all around should be considered <strong>work in progress</strong>: there are no guarantees that the ideas, the proposals and even the presentations that we are developing here in the open will make it into production one day.</p>

<p>You can have a look at our <strong><a href="/ITStrategy/documents-and-presentations.html">Working Documents</a></strong>.</p>

<p>On the other end, we would gladly welcome your ideas and comments in order to continuously improve our work and, in a way, how ESDC offers its services to Canadians! Please look at <strong><a href="how-to-contribute.html">how to contribute</a></strong>.</p>

<p>We have set up a few continuous integration (CI) tests in order to keep our content clean but also to showcase how powerful these open collaboration tools can be to maintain a project, whether it is simple text files or source code.
You can have a look at our <a href="https://github.com/sara-sabr/ITStrategy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#instructions">documentation</a> to see how it works!</p>

<p>As part of our work, we will also write <a href="/ITStrategy/blog-posts.html">blog posts</a> on various topics to share our findings upon researching literature, reading books or simply discovering things that may be of interest to the government overall.</p>

<p>Please feel free to jump in the <a href="https://github.com/sara-sabr/ITStrategy/issues">Issues</a> and start exchanging with us!</p>

<p>~ The IT Strategy team</p>
