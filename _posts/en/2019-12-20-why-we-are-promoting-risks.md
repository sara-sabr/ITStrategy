In this blog, I am claiming that IT initiatives are currently governed in a way that ends up promoting risks instead of reducing them, lead to incorrect investments decisions, and ultimately reduces our ability to meet our fiduciary responsibility towards public funds as required in the Financial Administration Act.

## Problem Statement

Governance of IT initatives is required and I am in no way saying we need to remove it. However, the current methods seek a high level of predictability using advance planning and rigid plan execution which may work for physical assets like constructing a building but not work for intagible ones like software. In addition, the transition towards Digital Government is creating a future that is highly complex and uncertain which I argue requires a different means to govern IT investments: one that rewards an empirical cycle of trying, observing, and correcting.

At ESDC, we have a [Poliy on Project and Program Management (PPPM)](https://gpp-ppm.service.gc.ca/sites/pwa/ESDCKnowledgeRepository/All%20Documents/2-01PL-182E-Project%20and%20Programme%20Management%20Policy%20on-withBanner-v1.0.pdf) that complies with the Treasury Board (TB) Policy on Planning and Management of Investments. This Policy acts as the authoritative means under which all projects and programmes within ESDC are managed. The following [Project Lifecycle framework (PMLC)](https://gpp-ppm.service.gc.ca/sites/pwa/ESDCKnowledgeRepository/All%20Documents/02-05G-271E-ProjectLifeCycle-v4.0.pdf) is used to guide the management of projects, according to their classification in size (which is based on cost, risk, capability, and complexity. But really the cost variable is really driving this). A **small** IT project (one that is between $500k and $2.5M in size) is expected to produced between 21 and 34 project management artefacts, requires between 48 and 54 project management activities, and involves 16 stakeholders. This effort is to go through the PMLC, not to make actual software changes. For **major** IT projects (greater than $5M) we are looking at producing 24 to 39 artefacts, 52 to 60 activities, and same 16 stakholders.

- early commitment on scope, schedule, and cost
- change process
- receive feedback at end
- closure when it's ongoing

## Recommendations

- measurements and course corrections instead of control
- open source
- have right team (user with developers, security, policy) for rapid feedback loops
