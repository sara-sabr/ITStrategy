FWD50 looked very different this year.
From Nov 3-9, attendees and presenters joined the conference virtually, trading the magnificent [Pavillon Aberdeen](https://ottawa.ca/en/lansdowne#h3) for their couches and home offices.
The virtual platform used was [Grip](https://grip.events/), which provided agenda information and the ability for the user to build up their schedule to maximize their time for the four-day conference.

Each session had a [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com) channel where folks could watch the sessions with closed captioning and workshops used dedicated [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) rooms to provide interactives features to the participants.

On the side of each session display, a text chat feature allowed participants to share information with each other and ask questions, which opened up really interesting discussions and further improved networking opportunities.

During each session, there was also an opportunity for the users to tag a presenter to ask to network with them later.

Outside the main platform, there were virtual break out rooms where the participants could move their avatar to bump into friends and new acquaintances alike and have the sort of spontaneous conversations that happen at in-person conferences.
The services used to create those virtual rooms were [Kumospace](https://www.kumospace.com/) and [Wonder](https://www.wonder.me/).

The FWD50 team were very upfront at the beginning to say that there will likely be some hiccups along the way, and while there was one or two minor ones, the conference went very smoothly.

And the good news is that while a paid ticket was required to attend, a lot of content was and still is freely available.

Some of the presenters have made their presentations or details of their presentation open:

- Pia Andrews presented on [The Crisis Paradox For Leadership: Balancing Urgency and Importance](https://t.co/RELqF74GgK?amp=1)
- Honey Ducanay's part of the Delivering of the Speed of Need workshop entitled [Enabling conditions, not just heroics](https://t.co/a7u53IwYqs) is available on her blog
- Also from the 'Delivering at the Speed of Need workshop, the panelists made their [cheat sheet on delivering at the speed of need](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gL57LdKFFZOm5ngL1HqHubzzG80aLewDcJY8hTDqsaQ/edit#slide=id.p) openly available
- Simon Wardley's FWD50 presentation isn't public but a lot of [his presentations](https://wardley-maps-community.github.io/awesome-wardley-maps/) are openly available as is his book [Wardley maps: The use of topographical intelligence in business strategy](https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec). He also shared a link to a random [strategy generator](http://strategy-madlibs.herokuapp.com/) (the code for which is on GitHub code) which made a lot of us on the IT Strategy team chuckle as each refresh gives a new buzz-wordy nonsense strategy.
- Ann-Marie Cavanagh, Deputy Government Chief Digital Office and Deputy Chief Executive Digital Public Service, New Zealand, shared her governments [Digital Strategy](https://www.digital.govt.nz/digital-government/strategy/strategy-summary/strategy-for-a-digital-public-service/) and [Digital Inclusion Outcomes Framework](https://www.digital.govt.nz/dmsdocument/167~digital-inclusion-outcomes-framework/html) during her talk on COVID-19 and Economic Recovery: New Zealand's lessons learnt on digital inclusion and resilience.
- The folks who participated on the Can the Platform Be Of Service? - The Commitment To Person-centred Design When Adopting Tech Models In The Public Sector, made the highlights of their presentation available in this ['Can the platform be of service' miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kg8Sr3c=/).

In a great example of the community working openly, a google doc was spontaneously created by a FWD50 attendee to capture all the books that were mentioned by speakers. This [list of books](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kyq80aMy_a6wnOdaHgzYLqSaqKfmjMmBdDnXKy6N4YQ/edit#heading=h.kr7a4cpsy27s) was shared with all attendees and anyone could add to it when a book was mentioned.

Some articles and other documents/tools that were shared by speakers include:
