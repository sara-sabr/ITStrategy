FWD50 looked very different this year. From Nov 3-9, attendees and presenters joined the conference virtually from their couches and home offices.  vimeo, and zoom. Each session had a vimeo channel where folks could watch with live transcription (using x software). The text chat feature for each session allowed participants to share information with each other and ask questions. In each session there was an opportunity to tag a presenter to ask to network with them later to learn more and there were virtual break out rooms where you could bump into friends and new acquaintances alike to have the sort of spontaneous conversations that happen at in-person conferences. The tech used to create those virtual rooms is x and x.

The FWD50 team were very upfront at the beginning to say that there will likely be some hiccups along the way, and while there was one or two minor ones, the conference went very smoothly.

And the good news is that while a paid ticket was required to attend, a lot of content is freely available.

Some of the presenters have made their presentations or details of their presentation open:

- Pia Andrews presented on [The Crisis Paradox For Leadership: Balancing Urgency and Importance](https://t.co/RELqF74GgK?amp=1)
- Honey Ducanay's part of the Delivering of the Speed of Need workshop entitled [Enabling conditions, not just heroics](https://t.co/a7u53IwYqs) is available on her blog
- Also from the 'Delivering at the Speed of Need workshop, the panelists made their [cheatsheet on delivering at the speed of need](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gL57LdKFFZOm5ngL1HqHubzzG80aLewDcJY8hTDqsaQ/edit#slide=id.p) openly available
- Simon Wardley’s FWD50 presentation isn’t public but a lot of [his presentations](https://wardley-maps-community.github.io/awesome-wardley-maps/) are openly available as is his book [Wardley maps: The use of topographical intelligence in business strategy](https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec). He also shared a link to a random [strategy generator](http://strategy-madlibs.herokuapp.com/) (the code for which is on GitHub code) which made a lot of us on the IT Strategy team chuckle as each refresh gives a new buzz-wordy nonsense strategy.
- Ann-Marie Cavanagh, Deputy Government Chief Digital Office and Deputy Chief Executive Digital Public Service, New Zealand, shared her governments [Digital Strategy](https://www.digital.govt.nz/digital-government/strategy/strategy-summary/strategy-for-a-digital-public-service/) and [Digital Inclusion Outcomes Framework](https://www.digital.govt.nz/dmsdocument/167~digital-inclusion-outcomes-framework/html) during her talk on COVID-19 and Economic Recovery: New Zealand's lessons learnt on digital inclusion and resilience.
- The folks who participated on the Can the Platform Be Of Service? - The Commitment To Person-centred Design When Adopting Tech Models In The Public Sector, made the highlights of of their presentaion available in this ['Can the platform be of service' miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kg8Sr3c=/).

In a great example of the community working openly, a google doc was spontaneously created by a FWD50 attendee to capture all the books that were mentioned by speakers. This [list of books](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kyq80aMy_a6wnOdaHgzYLqSaqKfmjMmBdDnXKy6N4YQ/edit#heading=h.kr7a4cpsy27s) was shared with all attendees and anyone could add to it when a book was mentioned.

Some articles and other documents/tools that were shared by speakers include:

- https://hbr.org/2014/08/curiosity-is-as-important-as-intelligence

There were many people who were live-tweeting the event under the #FWD50 hashtag. But if going through that feels overwhelming, then there were some standout live tweeters who's FWD50 feeds are worth checking out:

- [Sean Boots](https://twitter.com/search?q=Sean%20boots%20and%20fwd50&src=typed_query)
- [Kofi Arthiabah](https://twitter.com/search?q=Kofi%20Arthiabah%20-%20TC%20and%20FWD50&src=typed_query)
- [Andee Pittman](https://twitter.com/search?q=Andee%20Pittman%20(she%2Fthey)%20AND%20fwd50&src=typed_query)

**note to Guilaume, is there a way to get just the above folks fwd50 tweets AND display them in chronological order? Also, is this a good list? I want it to be diverse.

As always with FWD50 it is impossible to leave this conference without finding new interesting people to follow.  Some of our new follows include:

- add twitter handles with names and what they do here
