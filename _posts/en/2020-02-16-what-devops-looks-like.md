In case you haven't noticed, there has been a large shift in our job as the technology organization of ESDC. We are now, more than ever, required to respond exponential change in technology and requirements faster, cheaper and with high quality. Gone are the days where we can plan for projects 5-10 years in advance. We've seen it over and over that by the time these projects are completed we have expended significant resources to produce a product that no longer meets our clients needs and are forced to spend even more to catch up to changed requirements. Continuing with this operating model means we are taking on significant risk in not being able to respond to the increasing social change and needs of our citizens. Fortunately, we are not a unique case, many technology organizations around the world are facing similar issues in both the public and private domain. A lot of organizations have responded to this by adopting DevOps methodolgies, techniques, tools and processes. You may have heard your co-worker, manager talking about the need to apply DevOps principles. You may have even been assigned to evaluate how best to incorporate DevOps principles in your team. What does DevOps actually look like in terms of our organization? More specifically, how can we incorporate these principles in our release process to be able to enable daily releases, automated testing, zero trust security and be able to quickly respond to changes and what work needs to be done to shift to this model.
