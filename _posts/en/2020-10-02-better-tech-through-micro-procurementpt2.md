excerpt: "The Government of Canada (GC) buys a lot of stuff.
In 2016, the total spent by the GC on goods and services was ~$16 billion.
From an IT point of view, this spending can include big-ticket items like new data centres and new national applications costing tens of millions of dollars, but can also include low dollar value items like paying someone to build a small prototype over the course of a few days. This is part two of a series looking at how micro-procurements can bring IT and procurement folks together to enable agile, rapid, and scalable digital work."

This is part two of a two part series looking at micro-procurement for digital work.
In this second post, what makes micro-procurement challenging, as well as what we are planning at ESDC

## Whatâ€™s stopping us from doing micro-procurement of digital work

A big challenge in implementing micro-procurement within the GC is that while policy provides flexibility to allow for simplified micro-procurement, departmental rules around procurement are often hard-coded into large financial systems that are costly to make changes to.
And even when departmental rules are not hard-coded into systems, they can often be inflexible and hard to change. If you have heard "This is how we do this at x department" then you know what we mean.
Departmental procurement rules often include things like:  the types and number of internal documents that are required, how acquisition cards are used (types of procurement and maximum $ amounts), processes related to getting funds committed, and whether or not a business number is required from a supplier.

Fear of doing something wrong and getting audited is often a reason that procurement process rules are hard to change.The web of procurement rules is real and there is a reason we have procurement offcers who have had extensive training to help us navigate that web.
They help ensure that things are done by the book and no-one loses their financial signing authority or worse, gets fired. The tricky thing is that procurement policy is open to interpretation (like most legislation and policy) and because of this, appetite for risk becomes a factor.
Departments with procurement teams with a low appetite for risk makes the sales pitch for micro-procurement harder. Not that micro-procurement is risky. Its actually very low risk.
But teams with a low appetite for risk, concerns about things like contract splitting...

In order for micro-procurement to be possible, we (IT) must break the work that needs doing into small chunks.
We aren't great at this. We have been used to grouping tasks together into large projects for so many years.  We did that for a reason....grouping activities together into a larger procurement reduced the need to go through the 'pain' of procurement more than once.
But also we aren't necessarily good at knowing what we need or diagnosing the problem to be fixed so often IT solution procurements are end to end - to help with planning, design, build, implementation.
Smaller chunks of work often end up getting covered by large maintenance/support contracts.

Lastly and certainly not least, working together across branches in the GC can be hard.
But setting up a process and system for micro-purchasing of open source code by necessity involves folks from both the CIO and the CFO branches of a department.  
But any systems change requires working together towards change. A simplified process for micro-procurement would mean that procurement officers would not touch or have a very limited touch on a file.
Procurement knowledge and authority would shift to the line of business.

(link to the article that Sean posted about - understanding why the wall is there before you tear it down).  Address existential threat of automation, and shifting LDV procurement to lines of business.

## Now what?

Knowing and understanding these challenges has helped us move forward with a micro-procurement initiative at ESDC. We are in the early stages and we are prgamatically containing our excitement however we are happy to say that we are moving the initiative forward in partnership with the procurement innovation team at ESDC. From the startTogether we are working on a streamlined process specifically for micro-procurements. This process will also result in rapid payment of suppliers as we have been given the ok to pay suppliers by credit card once the code has been delivered and assessed to meet criteria.
