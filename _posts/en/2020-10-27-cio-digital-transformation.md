In this blog, we explain that its CIOs and CFOs that will bring a Digital Transformation vision into a reality. Although Digital Transformation deals a lot with changing business operations, if technology releases are not able to push through, that vision will remain a dream and will not manifest itself. We will show how critical CFOs are in allowing technology to respond faster to continuous business changes.

## What Digital Transformation Entails

On April 1, 2020, [Treasury Board's (TB) Policy on Service and Digital](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32603) came into effect which serves "_as an integrated set of rules that articulate how Government of Canada organizations manage service delivery, information and data, information technology, and cyber security in the digital era_". The Policy supports the [mandate of the Minister for Digital Government](https://pm.gc.ca/en/mandate-letters/2019/12/13/minister-digital-government-mandate-letter) and is guided by a commitment to the guiding principles and best practices of the [Government of Canada Digital Standards](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html).

As the Policy's requirements target Deputy Heads, we look at its associated [Directive](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32601) for requirements targeting the senior officials designated to be responsible for leading particular functions (i.e. CIO, Service, and Cyber Security). Here are some statistics the IT Strategy team did ([link to source data](/assets/files/Policy_on_service_and_digital_analysis.xlsx)):

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Official</th>
    <th>&#37; of Total Reqs.</th>
    <th>Mandatory Procedures (4) reqs&#42;</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="font-size:x-large; font-weight:bold;">CIO <span style="font-size:medium">(w/ Chief Data Officer)</span></td>
    <td style="font-size:x-large; font-weight:bold;">84&#37;</td>
    <td style="font-size:x-large; font-weight:bold;">229</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Service</td>
    <td>10&#37;</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cyber Security</td>
    <td>6&#37;</td>
    <td>74</td>
  </tr>
</table>

&#42; The four mandatory procedures are: [Enterprise Architecture Assessment](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32602), [Application Programming Interface](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32604), [Privacy and Monitoring of Network and Device Use Information Notices](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32607), and [IT Security Controls](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32611)

With such strong a strong focus on CIOs, the TB Policy on Service and Digital formally recognizes the **ubiquitous nature of technology in delivering services** to Canadians. Technology is no longer a back-office function. It's at the core of service delivery. Anyone working in technology already knew that, but they now have the attention of **elected officials**.

This means that in order for policy makers to affect Canadians, they will need to go through technology delivery. If technology is not responsive enough, the lag between Policy making and service delivery directly impacts departments ability to fulfill their mandates. Policy makers looking for data to inform their evidence-based decision making (user feedback loops) will be stored in databases, managed by software.

<div style="display: block; width: inherit; text-align: center;">
    <a href="/ITStrategy/assets/images/digital_feedback_loop.png" style="display: block">
        <img src = "/ITStrategy/assets/images/digital_feedback_loop.png"
        alt = "The feedback loop policy makers need pass through technology."
        style="width: 500px; height: inherit;"
        />
    </a>
    <small>The feedback loop policy makers need pass through technology</small>
</div>

This lag in responsiveness happened in the past, impacted elected officials, and made [front-page news](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/federal-it-systems-critical-failure-1.5448871). This inadequate relationship organizations have with technology is documented in [Auditor General](https://sara-sabr.github.io/ITStrategy/2020/04/21/how-is-the-public-service-managing-large-IT-project.html) reports that, [even 10 years ago](https://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_oag_201004_01_e_33714.html), recognized the critical nature technology plays in servicing Canadians.  

We want to look at this relationship with technology closer.

## How Are We Managing Technology Investments

Using technology is risky and costly.

At ESDC, we have a [Policy on Project and Program Management (PPPM)](https://gpp-ppm.service.gc.ca/sites/pwa/ESDCKnowledgeRepository/All%20Documents/Policy%20on%20Project%20and%20Programme%20Management.pdf) that complies with the [TB Policy on Planning and Management of Investments](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32593). This financial policy instrument governs how investments are to be managed in the department and we narrow it to achieve to broad goals:

1. Managing **risks**
2. Placing investments where there are **benefits**

We want to look closer at &#35;1 especially when our [2019-2020 Departmental Plan](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/reports/departmental-plan/2019-2020.html) states that "_The Department [...] recognizes recognizes that one of the biggest risks it faces is a failure to take risks._"[^1]. The PPPM is where the [Project Lifecycle framework (PMLC)](https://gpp-ppm.service.gc.ca/sites/pwa/ESDCKnowledgeRepository/All%20Documents/Project%20Life%20Cycle.pdf) takes its root from (a framework to guide the management of projects).

The current method to manage technology investments seeks a **predictable future** to a high degree. But moving to digital, this future becomes highly complex and is anything but predictable. This should warrant us to find new methods of managing technology investments: one that rewards an empirical cycle of trying, observing, and correcting. [^2]

The current method will start with a **business case** which sets expectations for **benefits realization**. But we should not see it as such. We should instead see it as a **hypothesis**. We _think_ we will obtain certain benefits. But we cannot be sure until we try it. Between the business case and the benefits realization, you will have the technology portion where IT personnel is asked to provide **estimates** (how long and how costly this idea will be). But anyone in the technology field will tell you those are not estimates. They are **commitments**. Should such estimates change (and they will), it is too often perceived as a _failure to plan_.

In the end, this method of managing technology investments:

- Produces **21 to 34** project documents,
- Requires **48 to 58** project management activities, and
- Involves **21 to 24** stakeholders &#42;

&#42; we've added 10 more stakeholders than what is listed in the PMLC because our [Senior Advisors mapping of the software release process](onenote:http://dialogue/grp/PR6893344/OneNote/AppDevSA/02-Development%20(In%20Progress)/AppDev%20Roadmap.one#Outcomes%20and%20Dependencies%20Overview&section-id={5E16E60C-310B-49EF-8451-88E0CE4DA968}&page-id={67E8C1D8-F39B-498E-A809-EEAAB9BDAC88}&object-id={636B6DD3-FBD6-0F8E-30F2-FD3A0BC5F22E}&2E) shows us there are more IT personnel involved.

In this method, we raise two important observations:

1) The definition of success (what outcomes are we looking to gain, and how will they be measured) are hidden in one of the 21 to 34 documents: the **business case**
2) The **client** (the user or her representation) is not involved throughout the project

The above methodology has an adverse effect: it **promotes feature bloating**.

Lines of Business (LOB) will wait until they accumulate sufficient changes that warrant the burden of going through this waterfall process. This will increase the size of technology projects and trigger the immune system of the organization because large technology projects are risky:

Large technology projects risks **locking** the organization into a potentially bad idea (hypothesis) for too long.

Large technology projects **clogs** the organization's limited resources. As we commit resources to one large hypothesis, the other LOBs are waiting for their turn as they are being told "not enough capacity". This further promotes feature bloating since LOBs wait sometimes for _years_ until they have a chance to get IT's attention. And once they do, don't you DARE ask them to compromise on their requirements. They've been waiting for 7 years!!! Not to mention that one of those business cases waiting is **Technical Debt Remediation**: unattractive, technical-lingo filled proposals asking for funds without augmenting any features to end-users. Technical Debt somehow has to compete with feature rich and attractive investment proposals. It's a loosing battle that is too often passed on as a problem for a next senior leader to deal with.

Large technology projects have a **very low success rate**. Here are some statistics:

- The [Standish Group](https://18f.gsa.gov/2019/04/09/why-we-love-modular-contracting/) studied 3,555 projects from 2003 to 2012 with labour cost of at least $10 million USD and found that only **6.4&#37;** of them were successful.
- [5 Auditor General Reports](https://sara-sabr.github.io/ITStrategy/2020/04/21/how-is-the-public-service-managing-large-IT-project.html) raised attention on large technology projects in difficulty, with one mentioning the above Standish Group report and commenting "_We are concerned that although research clearly indicates that small IT projects are more likely to succeed than large ones, departments and agencies are again undertaking large IT projects_"[^3]. These 5 Auditor General Reports are: [2006 Novembre](https://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_oag_200611_03_e_14971.html), [2010 Spring](https://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_oag_201004_01_e_33714.html), [2011 June](https://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_oag_201106_02_e_35370.html), [2015 Spring](https://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_oag_201504_05_e_40351.html), and [2018 Spring](https://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_oag_201805_01_e_43033.html).
- Canadian [House of Commons questions from 2016 and 2019](https://large-government-of-canada-it-projects.github.io/) on ongoing or planned IT Projects over $1M CAD shows that 87% of them are behind schedule and 56% over budget.
- A review the IT Strategy team did of an [internal Enterprise Project Management Office](http://dialogue/grp/IPPST/Financials%20Limited%20Access/Monthly%20Project%20Portfolio%20Dashboard%20-%20January%202019-2020%20(P10).xlsx) sample dashboard found that more than half of large scale projects are yellow or red during the execution phase (in trouble). We are not surprised of this information as all the advance planning done pre-execution, sometimes years in advance, is now facing reality and requires to be adjusted.

Large technology projects **impedes** the organization to iterate on its policies.

> Only **successful projects, in production**, enable the organization to gain **empirical evidence** necessary for their **evidence-based decision making**.

The above feature bloating effect is also seen with **procurement activities**: the production of large Request For Proposals (RFPs). Are we really surprised that only a handful of large private suppliers can be eligible to, and willing to bid on, government technology RFPs?

## Recommendations

Risk Management is an expertise of the CFO and new methods of developing technology have surfaced (e.g. [Cloud and DevOps](https://youtu.be/2BM0xYfcexY?t=940)) that warrants CIOs and CFOs working together in adjusting risk management methodologies.

The ESDC IT Strategy team is currently working on a set of strategies in moving the organization towards reducing risks associated with technology in order to accelerate business flexibility.

1) [Target IT Solution Delivery Model](https://sara-sabr.github.io/ITStrategy/strategy-target-solution-delivery-model.html): a strategy to move the organization towards **same day software deployment**. This requires focusing on loose coupling architectures and changing governance processes to provide more autonomy to IT teams, moving to Product Management with a supporting funding model and clear business shared accountability defined, adopting DevOps, and setting clear conditions for IT project intakes with an ability for the CIO to say "_No_".
2) [Adopt, Build, Buy](https://sara-sabr.github.io/ITStrategy/strategy-build-vs-buy.html): a strategy that seeks to resolve the oversimplification approach of _buying_ or _building_ software. The strategy proposes moving ESDC to the point where all stakeholders understand that IT Solutions are complex and investment decisions have to be taken with flexibility, interchangeability, and interoperability in mind throughout the entire lifecycle of an IT Solution, not only at the initial stage.
3) [Continuous Improvement](https://sara-sabr.github.io/ITStrategy/strategy-transform-high-performing-org.html): a strategy to transform ESDC into a high-performing organization through the continuous improvement of daily work. Influenced by the [DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) DevOps capabilities](https://cloud.google.com/devops/).
4) [Micro-Procurement (GCDevExchange 2.0)](https://014gc.sharepoint.com/sites/GCDevEx): a strategy that seeks to provide the department and suppliers with a light-weight, low dollar value (&lt; $10k) contract amount, procurement process. Resulting work from such contract is to be made available under an Open Source licence.
