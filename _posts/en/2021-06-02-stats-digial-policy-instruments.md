This blog highlights the amount of requirements that Treasury Board (TB) policy instruments puts on the different senior officials, the CIO in particular, in enabling the transition towards digital.
<!--more-->

A number of TB policy instruments were re-adjusted as part of the Policy Suite Reset exercise, some of which encompasses the broad "Digital" policy suite of instruments.
We see a clear indication that **lines of business need to develop strong technical acumen** to understand digital and **plan their digital [products roadmaps](https://www.pmi.org/disciplined-agile/process/product-management)**.
We also see how **technologists need to foster greater empathy towards their business partners** regarding how technology is to enable all service delivery and how it affects the cyber security landscape of government.

We've analyzed a total of 31 policy instruments (Policies, Directives, Standards, and Mandatory Procedures). Here are some statistics around the number of requirements each senior official is accountable for.

Some needed ESDC context (that may be different in other departments):

- The person holding the role of CIO also holds the role of a Departmental Official responsible for Cyber Security (DOCS). As such, that person is effectively accountable for both CIO and DOCS requirements.
- the Chief Security Officer (CSO) reports to the Assistant Deputy Minister (ADM) that is responsible for Identity Management (a different ADM than the one holding the role of CIO/DOCS). So in the statistics below, we have indicated that Identity Management requirements fall under the CSO.
- The CIO is currently the one signin-off Algorithmic Impact Assessments (AIA), not the Business-level ADM. As such, we have indicated that the Directive on Automated Decision Making and its AIA requirements fall under the CIO.
- Policy instruments do not mention the role of a Chief Data Officer (CDO). Instead they put the accountability of data under the CIO. At ESDC, we have a CDO that reports to a different ADM than the CIO. We have placed accountability to the CDO within the context of the Mandatory Procedures for Enterprise Architecture Assessment.
