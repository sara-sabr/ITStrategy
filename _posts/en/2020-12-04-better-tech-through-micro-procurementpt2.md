This is part two of a two-part series looking at micro-procurement for digital work.
In this second post, we look at what makes implementing micro-procurement challenging, as well as a sneak peek at what we are planning at ESDC.

## What’s stopping the GC from doing micro-procurement of digital work

The web of procurement rules is real and we are lucky to have procurement officers who have had extensive training to help us navigate that web.
They help ensure that things are done by the book and no-one loses their financial signing authority or worse, gets fired.
Like all policy, though, procurement policy is open to interpretation and because of this, appetite for risk (by that procurement officer or procurement team) becomes a factor in implementing any procurement innovation.
It can be seen as safer to continue doing things the same way.

Another challenge can be that while policy provides flexibility to allow for simplified micro-procurement, departmental rules around procurement are often hard-coded into large financial systems that are costly, or difficult to make changes to.
And even when departmental rules are not hard-coded into systems, they can often be inflexible and hard to change.
If you have heard "This is how we do this at x department" then you know what we mean.
As a result, across the GC, smaller, low-risk procurements usually go through the same process as much larger, complex procurements.

In order for micro-procurement to be possible, we (IT) must break our work out into small chunks.
We aren't used to doing this.
We have been grouping tasks together into large projects for many years.
We do that for many reasons:

- we follow a project management process with extensive governance which intentionally or unintentionally encourages grouping tasks together into one large project
- the procurement process is unclear to many in IT and as a result often seen as painful.
Employees seek to reduce the pain by going through the process fewer times with larger projects.
- we have a history of working in a waterfall way rather than an agile way
  
As we move towards an agile/DevOps way of working, with same day deployments, the need for smaller work packages (and being able to procure these smaller work packages) increases.

Lastly, and certainly not least, any systems change requires breaking down silos and working together towards that change.
Setting up a process and system for micro-procurement of open source code, by necessity, involves folks from both the CIO and the CFO branches of a department.
Working together across branches in the GC can be hard.
We need to learn to speak each other’s languages, and we need to be flexible.
But it is so worth it.

## Our plans at ESDC

Knowing and understanding these challenges has helped us move forward with a [Micro-Acquisition Pilot](micro-acquisition-pilot.md) at ESDC.
We are in the early stages but we are happy to say that we are moving the initiative forward in partnership with ESDC's Procurement Innovation Team.
Together we are working on a streamlined process specifically for micro-procurements and on developing guardrails to enable teams to complete micro-procurements without procurement officer intervention.
We'll be working in the open and sharing updates as the pilot moves along.
