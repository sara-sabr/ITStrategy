## Background
_Current mandate of ESDC_: The mission of Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), including the Labour Program and Service Canada, is to build a stronger and more inclusive Canada, to support Canadians in helping them live productive and rewarding lives and to improve Canadians’ quality of life  

_Current role of ESDC_: ESDC offers a range of programs and services such as seniors with basic income security, supports unemployed workers, helps students finance their post-secondary education and assists parents who are raising young children.   

_Preparing for the future_: Technology is redesigning human lives like never before - from how we reach to work to how University courses are delivered today. Due to the pervasiveness of global social and corporate influence, we may see a significant change in our preferences and habits. Our perceptions of well being and quality of life may be pegged on different attributes such as mental health, social inclusion, job security and continuous professional growth.   

Global technology trends are fast changing the economic and political situations around the world – redistributing wealth, the nature of work and opportunities. Global markets are seeing a shift from mainstream economics of scarcity towards economics of abundance. Digital goods and services are commonplace as commodities and information is universally accessible through high speed networks -making global market more cohesive.    

The emergence of new job roles, occupations and industries, and corporations with global workforce may lead to new challenges and social issues such as wage polarization, global skill competition, labour mobility, and unpredictable workforce demand. 

Planning ahead will prepare Canadians stay ahead of the technological curve and exploit their full potential.  
In pursuit of improving quality of life for Canadians, ESDC needs to manage these changes in society and provide a support structure to prepare Canadians towards unprecedented risks and disruption from global participants.  

## Vision 
Emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, blockchain and high speed network provides tremendous opportunities to renew the ESDC service delivery and augment the experience for Canadians. With informed choices, Canada can further the impact of its social safety net and make a more inclusive society.   

Canada has a unique and well-developed social welfare system. However, with the changing economic and social climate, this may quickly become outdated – impacting our economic growth and employment rate. Social inclusion and quality of life would …   

**_Experimental initiatives and redefining services_**  
With no proven path yet and countries around the globe grappling to give sense to the advancement in technology, Canada needs to put in efforts to   
* keep a watch on global trends,   
* evolve new services based on changing economic and social structure   
* understand overall implications and devise risk mitigation strategies   
Toiling with ideas may need to develop quick-evolving initiatives to experiment and learn.     

**_Regulatory sandbox and data to function together_**  
In this picture of digital transformation, there are two main actors - regulations and data.   
Where regulations are largely in the formative stage with no definitive outcomes yet conceived, functioning of data together to fulfil desired outcomes has also become a challenge.   

Regulatory sandboxes may be a safe avenue to try and moderate the impact of regulations  

Giving meaning to data by bringing it together for public interest…. Policies surrounding accessibility and use of data to fully exploit the data for public interest …Interoperability of data   
> Example of Taiwan and Finland regulatory sandbox, India National AI Marketplace   

**_PPP model/Open source policy model/Open government_**
To fully exploit the potential of technologies, public sector needs to adopt new cooperation models with private sector and citizens. Joint contribution towards a project have created a few success stories among countries like Australia, New Zealand and others …   

The distribution of power and resources may have to be revisited and adjusted to develop greater responsiveness in public services.   

Utilize the global knowledge and resources …  

**_Social cohesion_**  
Social cohesion and open debate between different population groups  
Pedagogical initiatives

## Mandate
Our mandate is to architect and support implementation of a secure foundation of transformational technology to fulfil ESDC’s envision of human-centric service delivery in renewed social fabric, (and forge a trust relationship among Canadians) and create a cohesive environment for participation of citizens and corporations towards mutual societal (welfare) development goals   
~~Our mandate is to envision the role of ESDC in the fast changing landscape of social behaviour and needs, and drive human-centric service delivery through transformational technology and innovation~~

## Priorities of the branch
* (GIVING VISION & STRATEGY) Envisioning and architecting a secure and central system to lay the foundation for digital transformation
* (STRATEGY, PRIORITY & INVESTMENT) Providing foresight and prioritising investment on transformational service delivery programs 
* (POLICY, NEW COOPERATION MODELS) Forge social partnerships with private sector for utilizing their business expertise and information to meet service delivery goals 
* (STRATEGY & PRIORITY) Direct research strategy and developmental efforts for innovation teams such as DevOps
* (POLICY) Initiate dialogues to continuously evolve on using next-generation technologies 
* (POLICY) Recommend governing guidelines for the use of data and technologies 
* (INTEROPERABILITY & RESOURCE ALLOCATION) Mobilize resources to support quick turn around time to deploy innovation practices, and act as a synchronizer for efficient running of existing practices alongside the new practices
* (RISK AND COMPLIANCE) Develop guidelines for secure use of information and data during the implementation of transformational programs 

~~Governance focus include:
o Design principles for IT governance (_could introduce a new bimodal governance structure here_)
o Investment and priorities (_will help create a new category of exploratory projects_)
o Architecture (_prepare for the future, HDLC?_)
o Infrastructure use (_manage resources, coordinate between departments_)
o Client needs (_transform service delivery through adoption of advanced technologies_)
o Client engagement (_collect feedback and develop trust among citizen for use of data_)~~    

## Activities
**_Policy and strategy development_**
* Initiate new exploratory programs/projects and secure required funding/resources (_Who makes the submissions? Does each branch make their own submission? Does all submission go through CIO for approval first? Does IITB play a central role in project submissions? Within IITB is it Denis’s group that would do that?_)
* Recommend policies and program guidelines for digital products/services (_Who approves or make decisions on policies?_)
* Recommend suitable governance guidelines for exploratory programs/projects
* Create 3-year plan for research and development strategy for DevOps (_How would DevOps be governed? Are they independent?_)
* Ensure that ESDC’s technology programs/initiatives aligns with the themes of the strategic framework and priorities of the department
* Develop adoption strategy for modern/futuristic technology, including architecture design (enterprise, technical and solutions)  
**_Program(s) Management_**
* Continuously monitor technology trends to keep pace with technological development
* Perform risk identification and risk management (modern and secure technology)
* Network architecture design  
**_Resource Allocation_**
* Allocate resources between various projects/initiatives 
* Improve the sharing of information and resources between programs and across departments (How would bimodal work?)  
**_Organization Engagement_**
* Coordinate with other departments to centralize use and allocation of IT resources 
* Create/lead a working group (_invites members from across organizations_) for gathering information on prevailing IT challenges
* Stimulate dialogues on the use of technology to improve services  

## Redesigning governance style
To keep pace with the digital habits of the citizens, ESDC needs to adopt technology at a much faster pace for service delivery. The IM and IT policies laid out by Treasury Board focuses on efficiency, stability and accuracy. Existing IM/IT governance style work well with projects associated with proven methodologies and technologies.   
However, it inherits some barriers for implementing exploratory projects. Exploratory projects are associated with innovating or experimenting to deliver a sudden transformation of business outcome. Redefining governance policies may be needed to promote:
* Adoption of lean culture and continuous/agile delivery practices for churning out new products and services 
* Initiate exploratory programs without sacrificing risk aversion governing nature 
* Tight alignment of programs with the branch priorities 
* Improves time-to-market and product evolution (Principle: "Fail fast")
* Make innovation a sustainable process

## Redefining the services 
Examples of new/emergent services:
* Skills accreditation:  To compete with the global workforce, giving standard accreditation to Canadian skills may ease the workforce recognition at a global stage. It also helps in creating a Canadian brand in different industries
* Social and corporate influence: It is nearly impossible to foresee social and corporate influence on Canadians lives in the coming future. Emergence of digital value chain, commoditisation of many skills/services and pervasiveness of data-centric applications are influencing human choices and needs. Sharing of data among government, businesses and individuals may seem natural and need of the hour. Government role in such a place may give rise to new services to individuals and businesses. 
* Future anticipation: With perceived wide scale adoption of AI and other technologies, there would a general displacement in the nature of work. This may require the citizens to retrain or learn new skills. ESDC can play a huge role in allaying the fears of citizens by anticipating their training and well-being needs through data-centric applications.
* portability of benefits, worker classification, and wage variability.
