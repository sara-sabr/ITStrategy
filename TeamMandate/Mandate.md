## Team's Guiding Principles 

### Add Value

All efforts must deliver measurable impacts. Implement strategies -- do not be a document factory 

### Work collaboratively

Collaborate with anyone and everyone who can _add value_. This includes, but is not limited to, all Canadians, all levels of government, all departments, all private sector organizations, and all governments. 

### Continuous learning

Learning must be a core part of daily activities to ensure up to date, modern, and well researched direction and strategy is provided to guide our actions. 

### Lead by Example

By using the approaches and technologies we champion, we will be able to better respond to, and anticipate, the challenges that will be faced.
