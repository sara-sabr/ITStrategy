# Team Charter
## Preface
### Intent
To provide clarity on the purpose and scope of the IT Strategy team for all stakeholders. This charter will:
- Communicate expectations to stakeholders
- Provide the basis for the working relationships between the IT Strategy team and the organization
- Provide clear expectations of how the team will add business value

### History
Before the digital era, the business-IT relationship was based on a "business-led, IT-enabled" approach. In the digital era, 
the business-IT relationship is based on a "business- and IT-led, technology-enabled" approach. 
In the digital era, it's no longer about aligning business and IT. Instead, it's about surviving extreme 
competition and prospering by integrating business and IT into a single digital business strategy that 
addresses business and IT strategy as one.

ESDC's Service Transformation strategy aspires to advance five goals guided by five principles. In addition, 
TBS Digital Operations Strategic Plan of 2018-2020 sets the direction of the federal government along six themes. 
Policy Horizons Canada (Horizons) is conducting foresight that educates the whole of Government  on disruptive forces on 
the horizon. These strategies, plans, and foresights set aspirations for the Government of Canada services to be:

1. Service-oriented and user-centered
2. Open, collaborative, accessible, and accurate government services
3. Digital-first and digital enabled government
4. Efficient and effective
5. Responsive to citizens continuous change of expectations

In order for ESDC to move towards this vision of digital government and services, it will require becoming a much more 
responsive, resilient, and omnipresent digital service provider. IT Strategies are needed to enable ESDC to leverage 
technologies in order to move towards this target state vision.

## Scope
The scope of the IT Strategy team will be applicable across the entire organization and framed by 
[IITB's high level priorities](http://esdc.prv/en/iitb/corporate/Who_We_Are/Plans_and_Priorities/index.shtml):
- Focus on the Core Business (of ESDC)
- Modernize IM/IT Service Delivery
- Be efficient in managing its operations
- Be connected with IM/IT partners and suppliers

The IT Strategy team will look at the service delivery capability of IITB, and of the greater ESDC landscape as it relates to digital services, for the next ten-year horizon. This will be prioritized  and focused in support of the business priorities by the ESDC Service Transformation agenda.

The IT Strategy team will work in the open and will engage ESDC stakeholders throughout their strategy development. These stakeholders will be IITB districts, developer communities, and greater Federal Government communities.

The primary focus of the IT Strategy team will be in support of business outcomes, specifically as it relates to ESDC's modernization agenda and the Treasury Board's new Policy on Service and Digital. This will, in turn, determine initiatives to support for building the IITB and greater ESDC capabilities.


## Governance and Assurance
### Governance
The governance of the IT Strategy will be generally directed by the Director General of Strategy, Architecture, and Business Relations (SABR). More specific directions will come from community engagement, TBS Digital Policy, ESDC Service Transformation Goals, and industry foresight.

The team will engage periodically with the following communities:
- GCDevOps
- ESDC IT Research
- ...

The decisions will be made based on peer-reviewed of artefacts and ratification of such artefacts by the DG Strategy, Architecture, and Business Relations.

### Assurance
The IT Strategy team will act as change agents to initiate the execution of the IT Strategies, identifying resistance and opportunities. IT Strategies will have considered the organizational current culture. Where resistance to change falls outside of the team's authority, escalation to the DG SABR will be used via briefing notes identifying the issue and recommendations.

Community engagement and relationships will be key to the success of IT Strategies. The team will foster strong relationship with the communities mentioned above to seek broad community support (bottom up approach) before strategies can be proposed to senior management (top down approach).

The IT Strategy team will assure it does not fall within the ivory tower trap by adhering to the concept of [the strategy is getting it done](https://twitter.com/AlexBenay/status/962712226741268480) and developing strategies for carving out space for the community to innovate.
