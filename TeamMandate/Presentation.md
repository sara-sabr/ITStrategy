# IT Strategy 

## Vision 

### Future Testimonials 

I just lost my job. It's been a month since my last paycheque and today I received a deposit of $1245.28 in my TD checking account. With this, I was able to buy groceries for my family while job hunting full time. 

As a student who isn't taking any courses this summer, I decided to look for work. My Government of Canada LinkedIn friend just sent me the perfect job opportunity to be an intern at Shopify. I'm excited for my interview next week!

## Proposed IITB Mandated Priorities

### Avoid Rework 

Work in the open

#### Repercussions

- All teams (Ex: devs, security and testing) must use git

#### Opportunities

- Visiblity will allow teams to understand an always up to date verison of the processes of other teams 
- Reduce rework from sharing and building on the work of others 
  - Example: CDS implements a secure document uploading project. CSE 

>Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector: 
Federal public servants are entrusted to use and care for public resources responsibly, for both the short term and long term.

... 

### Modern tools 

>Digital Operations Strategic Plan: 2018-2022
- public servants are more effective at delivering services, programs and policies when they have modern tools that help their work and a modern workplace
- public servants need professional development that keeps up with changing times and changing technology

#### Repercussions

- Blanket approve all future versions of widely supported and popular tools from trusted organizations 
  - Ex: Google Chrome, Google Docs, Google Hangouts, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Firefox, Slack, node, npm

#### Opportunities

- Requiring rigorus review and approval of tools enforces the use of dated tools which 
  - Reduce the ability for the workforce to complete their work 
  - Introduce security concerns by not keeping tooling up to date 

For exampe, node in the self service is 5 years out of date. As a result, there are missing security patches and are unable to use modern tools for validating the quality of work due to out of date functionality

### Integration over creation

Do not compete with the private sector. Teams must prioritize integrating ESDC services into the existing IT ecosystem over developing, or improving existing, client facing applications competing for Canadians' attention. Create jobs, not software. 

#### Repercussions

- Cancel any UI updates or modernizations for Job Bank 

#### Opportunities

- Assign resources to creating new ways of communicating with Canadians to better deliver services 
  - Allow Canadians to interact with Job Bank data through Alexa, Google Home, or any other home automation product 
  - Interact with Canadians about job opportunities through automated notifications through LinkedIn
  - Dedicate more resources focused exclusively on developing service interfaces 

``` delivering programs that help Canadians move through life’s transitions, from school to work, from one job to another, *from unemployment to employment* and from the workforce to retirement ```
... 

### Avoid Toil

Toil is the kind of work tied to running a production service that tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, devoid of enduring value, and that scales linearly as a service grows. 

#### Repercussions

- Re-define success 
  - https://twitter.com/STP_PTS/status/1144268119025885186

#### Opportunities

- Invest in automation 
  - 1 month per year (Ex: August) dedicated entirely to automation and process improvement
