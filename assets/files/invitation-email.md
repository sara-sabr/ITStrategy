Hi <'name of director or executive director'>,

I would like to request your participation in an interview that is being organized individually for all directors and executive directors in IITB.
This is part of the second edition of the IITB Diagnostic Study, conducted by the IT Strategy team in SABR.
This recurring study was approved by the DG Committee in 2021 and informed to the executive director committee at that time.
The inclusion of executive directors as interviewees is a new addition to this instance of the study and was requested by the committee in 2021.

The purpose of the interview is to uncover your team’s pain points, highlight success stories, and assess progress against the results from the initial study.
The information gathered will be used by the IT Strategy team and IITB management to inform the development of upcoming strategies.

For reference, a presentation summarizing the results of the first Diagnostic Study can be found here: <u>2021 IITB Diagnostic Study Summary and Results.</u>

Interview details:

- The interview will take approximately one hour

- This initiative will result in a “what we heard report” and an action plan for the branch may result

- Your responses will be kept completely confidential, and no names will be recorded

- Some questions seek your team members perspectives,therefore, it is best that they are consulted before the interview

Participation in these interviews is voluntary; however, I would like to ask for your support and participation.
Your input is highly valued and will influence the development of IT Strategies, future organizational prioritization exercises and operational plans.

Should you have any questions or comments, please contact me or the [IT Strategy team](mailto:EDSC.DGIIT.StrategieTI-ITStrategy.IITB.ESDC@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca).

**To book your interview, please book a time in the </u>Interview Calendar</u> and indicate which time you are available.**

Time slots between Feb 20th and April 21st, 2023 are available for reservation between 10 am and 12 pm or 1 pm and 3 pm.
Please indicate if you would like for the interview to be conducted in English or in French.
A calendar invitation will then be sent to you to confirm your time slot at which point the interview package will be sent to you (i.e., instructions, questions).
