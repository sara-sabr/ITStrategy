The IT Strategy team is organizing interviews with all directors and executive directors in IITB to understand their day-to-day experience within the branch and ESDC as a whole.
We want to uncover your team's pain points, highlight success stories and innovative ideas.

We will be using the information we gather to drive and inform the development of upcoming strategies and plans.
The purpose of this exercise is to review how we can invest in internal capabilities to improve our branch’s service delivery.

The following questions have been designed in collaboration with HR, ESDC Values and Ethics, Public Opinion Research, and data from the Public Service Employee Survey (PSES) to follow ESDC’s ethical code.

## How this benefits you

This is a great opportunity to influence IT strategies, to identify blockers within your team, and to bring to the surface new innovative ideas.
There will also be a comparative element with the results of this year’s study being assessed against the study conducted in 2021.

## How it will work

The interview will not take more than an hour.
There will be an interviewer and a note taker.
The interview questions will be provided in advance to give you time to reflect and ensure the best use of your time.

## Safe space

All answers provided during the interview are confidential.
No names or teams will be associated with answers in our notes.
Once all interviews have been completed, we will be developing a "What We Heard" report.
This report will not contain any names or prescriptive comments that could inadvertently highlight any particular team.
The report will be shared with directors for comment before being shared with the DGs.

Should a privacy request be received on this exercise the response will be ‘Nil’.
While this exercise remains subject to ATIP, no names will be recorded, therefore, no names will be included in an ATIP response.

To prepare for this series of interviews, we have consulted with the departmental Values and Ethics team to ensure we meet all Values and Ethics requirements.
