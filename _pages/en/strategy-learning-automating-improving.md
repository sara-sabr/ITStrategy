_We will actively manage this technical debt by ensuring that we invest at least 20% of all Development and Operations cycles on refactoring, investing in automation work and architecture and non-functional requirements (NFRs, sometimes referred to as the "ilities"), such as maintainability, manageability. scalability, reliability. testability, deployability, and security._

_**Relentlessly pursue continuous improvement.** The most important characteristic of high-performing teams is that they are never satisfied: they always strive to get better. High performers make improvement part of everybody's daily work._

_At the heart of Lean management is giving employees the necessary time and resources to improve their own work. This means creating a work environment that supports experimentation, failure, and learning, and allows employees to make decisions that affect their jobs. This also means creating space for employees to do new, creative, value-add work during the work week—and not just expecting them to devote extra time after hours._  
[...]  
_A fixed percentage of each squad's and chapter's time is allocated for improvement. Jordi says that the squads think of improvement activities as just regular work._

- _Top-performing companies are almost five times more likely than lower performers to have extensive learning cultures._
- _High performers are nearly two times more apt to say their learning functions help meet organizational business goals._
- _Employees in high-performing organizations share knowledge with their colleagues at a rate four times greater than that of workers in lower-performing firms._
- _Communication is supported by rewarding workers for learning. providing tools and resources for creating and sharing learning content, and making knowledge sharing a performance expectation at all levels._
- _Building a Culture of Learning found that three practices related to supporting a learning culture were particularly effective:_
  - _regularly updating personalized development plans for every employee_
  - _ensuring worker accountability for the learning specified in those plans_
  - _providing nonfinancial rewards and recognition for employee learning.__
