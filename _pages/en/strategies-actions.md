## IT Strategies and Actions

### Goals for all of IITB

- Culture of continuous learning, agile and open
- Reduce lead time for changes
- On demand deployment
- Recover from incidents/errors in less than 1 day
- Less than 15% of changes cause incidents/errors
- Teams interact through automated digital services

### IITB Must (Starting now! For all projects and teams!)

Format:

> - Strategic Action (**bold** = proposed priority)
>   - *Tangible Action*

#### Align with GC IT Direction

*Consult [Annex A](#Annex-A---Details-of-GC-Information-Technology-Direction) for details.*

#### Cultural

- **IT teams must use at least 10% of their time to learn/try new technologies, attend events/conferences, and stay up to date on trends and technologies related to their work**
  - *Make it a requirement in performance agreements of managers and team leads, or mandatory for all IT teams*
  - *Communications about the updated rules around learning and regular updates on upcoming learning opportunities*
  - *Organize biweekly "Tech Talks" to share knowledge within IITB (maybe this is IITB Showcase)*
  - *Create crowdsourced list of learning resources in GCpedia (link on Intranet)*

  - *Encourage Bi-Daily Team Standups to share learning out loud*
- **IT teams and other groups must have access to modern tooling, such as SaaS (Internet), mobile and desktop tools**
  - *[Unblock access to specific SaaS for IITB employees](web-services-access.html)*
  - *Review the criteria and value add for technology bricks for SaaS*
  - *Invest in bandwidth, DLP and document classification tool to enable more open access to Internet*
  - *Communications that employees can use SaaS on ESDC network for unclassified information only*
  - *Add all approved software to Application Catalogue (e.g. paying ones)*
  - *Automate parts of the software assessment and approval process*
  - *Share software certifications with other departments*
- **IT teams must have access to resources enabling learning and automation of testing, deployments and other manual processes**
  - *Temporary hiring of talent with programming skills (e.g. Co-op students, Casuals, [Talent Cloud](https://talent.canada.ca))*
  - *Reorganize IT teams, starting with staff that are looking for a new challenge*
- **[Hiring favours candidates who demonstrate adaptability, curiosity, and strong ethics](enable-learning.html)**
  - *Work with HR to adapt hiring processes (e.g. interview questions)*
- **Create a safe environment for experimentation/failure and hold blameless postmortems**
  - *Organize lunch between a team/project that recently failed and the DM*
  - *Setup regular communications about failures and lessons learned*
  - *Offer cloud sandboxes for experimentation*
- Build multidisciplinary teams capable of delivering services from start to end of life
- Encourages collaboration and fosters a culture of flexibility, mobility and well-being

#### Process

  - *Make it a requirement in performance agreements of managers and team leads, or mandatory for all IT teams*
  - *Communications about the updated rules around continuous improvements and automation*
  - *Add automation tools to Application Catalogue*
  - *Create centralized repository of scripts on GCcode*
  - *Assess RPA tools (Robotic Process Automation)*
