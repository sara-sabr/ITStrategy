- [Mandatory Procedures on Application Programming Interfaces](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32604)
  - Validate API design by consuming it with a production application within your organization
  - All APIs should be published to the API Store
- [Acceptable Network and Device Use](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32605)
  - Provide open access to Internet tools and services to support public servants in their work duties, enhance collaboration and networking with their peers

#### Process

- Where possible, remove the need for manual/committee approval
- Empower multidisciplinary teams and allow them to work on new ideas in pursuit of business goals that solve important problems
- Clients must be included from the start of projects and can submit regular feedback
- Break down work into small task and make ongoing work and backlog visible
- Services must be made accessible as APIs
- IT teams must work using Agile methodologies, iterate and continually improve solutions and services
- IT teams must use 10% of their time for automation of testing, deployments and other manual processes

#### Technical

- IT teams must automate tests (Unit, UAT, Security, ITSM ..)
- IT teams must automate builds and deployments for all environments (Dev, QA and Production)
- IT teams must save all projects artifacts to a version control system
- IT teams must have access to realistic test data
- EA must actively and fairly consider open standards (data formats/protocols) and open source software for all new purchases, upgrades or migrations (including cloud solutions)
- EA must be loosely coupled and enable IT teams to autonomously, experiment with ideas, and choose their own tools
- EA must enable deploy-anytime capabilities, with high degrees of automation
- EA and Security must provide developers with preapproved libraries
- Security must be involved from the start and in all phase for of projects
- Security must develop automated tests

#### Measurement

- IT teams must collect data throughout the value stream
- IT teams must established Work In Progress (WIP) limits based on team capacity and cognitive load
- IT teams must make collected data and project status visible to the business
