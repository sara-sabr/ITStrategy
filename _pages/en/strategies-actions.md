## IT Strategies and Actions

### Goals for all of IITB

- Culture of continuous learning, agile and open
- Reduce lead time for changes
- On demand deployment
- Recover from incidents/errors in less than 1 day
- Less than 15% of changes cause incidents/errors
- Teams interact through automated digital services

### IITB Must (Starting now! For all projects and teams!)

*Note: Bullets in **bold** are proposed priorities.*

#### Align with GC Information Technology Direction

- [Digital Standards](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html)
- [Digital Operations Strategic Plan: 2018-2022](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-operations-strategic-plan-2018-2022.html)
- [Policy](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32603) and [Directive on Service and Digital](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32601)
- [Mandatory Procedures for Enterprise Architecture Assessment](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32602)
- [Mandatory Procedures on Application Programming Interfaces](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32604)
- [Acceptable Network and Device Use](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32605)

*Consult [Annex A](#Annex-A---Details-of-GC-Information-Technology-Direction) for details.*

#### Cultural

- **IT teams must use at least 10% of their time to learn/try new technologies, attend events/conferences, and stay up to date on trends and technologies related to their work**
- **IT teams and other groups must have access to modern tooling, such as SaaS (Internet), mobile and desktop tools**
- **All IT teams must have at least 2 members with knowledge of programming to assist with process automation**
- **[Hiring favours candidates who demonstrate adaptability, curiosity, and strong ethics](enable-learning.html)**
- Create a safe environment for experimentation/failure and hold blameless postmortems
- Build multidisciplinary teams capable of delivering services from start to end of life
- Encourages collaboration and fosters a culture of flexibility, mobility and well-being

#### Process

- **Break down work into small task and make ongoing work and backlog visible**
- **IT teams must use 10% of their time for automation of testing, deployments and other manual processes**
- **Promote smaller investments over large ones, and monitor them based on business outcomes, not projects plans**
- **Move and support product management**
- **IT teams must work using Agile methodologies, iterate and continually improve solutions and services**
- Where possible, remove the need for manual/committee approval
- Empower multidisciplinary teams and allow them to work on new ideas in pursuit of business goals that solve important problems
- Clients must be included from the start of projects and can submit regular feedback
- Services must be made accessible as APIs

#### Technical

- **IT teams must save all projects artifacts to a version control system**
- **EA must actively and fairly consider open standards (data formats/protocols) and open source software for all new purchases, upgrades or migrations (including cloud solutions)**
- **EA must enable deploy-anytime capabilities, with high degrees of automation**
- **IT teams must automate tests (Unit, UAT, Security, ITSM ..)**
- **IT teams must automate builds and deployments for all environments (Dev, QA and Production)**
- IT teams must have access to realistic test data
- EA must be loosely coupled and enable IT teams to autonomously, experiment with ideas, and choose their own tools
- EA and Security must provide developers with preapproved libraries
- Security must be involved from the start and in all phase for of projects
- Security must develop automated tests

#### Measurement

- IT teams must collect data throughout the value stream
- IT teams must established Work In Progress (WIP) limits based on team capacity and cognitive load
- IT teams must make collected data and project status visible to the business
