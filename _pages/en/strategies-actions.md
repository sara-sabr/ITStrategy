## IT Strategies and Actions

- Goals
- Approach
- IITB Teams Must
- Appendix A - Details of GC Information Technology Direction

### Goals

- Continuous learning, automation and improvements
- Reduce lead time for changes and delivery of services/devices
- Recover faster incidents and errors
- Reduce frequency of incidents and errors
- Agile (break down work, sprints, retrospectives)
- Work in the open (data, information and code)
- Expose internal and external (all) services as APIs
- Teams interact through automated digital services

#### Goals for IT development and operation teams

- On demand deployment
- Recover from incidents/errors in less than 1 day
- Less than 15% of changes cause incidents/errors

#### Goals for IT service teams

- Self service

### Approach

The IT Strategy team will not create a 5 or 10 year plan to transform the organization.
For details on the objectives, see [Medium Term](it-picture-medium-term.html) and [Long Term](it-picture-long-term.html) IT Pictures.
Based on [DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA)](https://cloud.google.com/devops/) and the latest State of DevOps report, we want to focus on capabilities that enable high performing IT organizations.
This also aligns with GC IT Policy and Direction around [Digital government](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government.html).

Quarterly strategies and actions will be shared with all teams in IITB.
Following these actions will be mandatory as part of Management and team leads performance agreements.
Strategies will be reviewed and updated quarterly based on progress and effectiveness.
Below is a list of strategies and actions that could be used as quarterly strategies.

The first quarterly strategy for Q1 (2020-04 to 2020-06) will be [20% of time to learn, automate and improve](strategy-learning-automating-improving.html) (Draft).
