## IT Strategies and Actions

### Goals for all of IITB

- Culture of continuous learning, agile and open
- Reduce lead time for changes
- On demand deployment
- Recover from incidents/errors in less than 1 day
- Less than 15% of changes cause incidents/errors
- Teams interact through automated digital services

### IITB Must (Starting now! For all projects and teams!)

#### Align with GC Direction Digital Standards and Policy on Service and Digital

- [A service-oriented government with a user-centred approach that puts people and their needs as the primary focus of our work.](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-operations-strategic-plan-2018-2022.html)
- Cloud-first [Plan](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-operations-strategic-plan-2018-2022.html#ToC10_1), [Policy](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12755) and [Adoption Strategy](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/modern-emerging-technologies/cloud-services/government-canada-cloud-adoption-strategy.html#toc6)
- IT teams must work in the open (data, information, projects, code), and not doing so is the exception.
- EA must actively and fairly consider open standards (data formats/protocols) and open source software for all new purchases, upgrades or migrations (including cloud solutions).
- Services must be made accessible as APIs and available on the API store
- Access to common Internet (SaaS) must be open by default

#### Cultural

- IT teams must use 10% of their time to learn/try new technologies, attend events/conferences and stay up to date on trends and technologies related to their work
- Create a safe environment for experimentation/failure and holds blameless postmortems
- IT teams and other groups must have access to SaaS (Internet), mobile and desktop tools
- Build multidisciplinary teams around projects
- Encourages collaboration and fosters a culture of flexibility, mobility and well-being
- All teams must have at least two members with knowledge of programming to assist with process automation

#### Process

- IT teams must use 10% of their time for automation of testing, deployments and other manual processes
- Where possible, remove the need for manual/committee approval
- Empower multidisciplinary teams and allow them to work on new ideas in pursuit of business goals that solve important problems
- IT teams must work using Agile methodologies, iterate and continually improve solutions and services
- Clients must be included from the start of projects and can submit regular feedback
- Break down work into small task and make ongoing work and backlog visible

#### Technical

- IT teams must automate tests (Unit, UAT, Security, ITSM ..)
- IT teams must automate builds and deployments for all environments (Dev, QA and Production)
- IT teams must save all projects artifacts to a version control system
- IT teams must have access to realistic test data
- EA must be loosely coupled and enable IT teams to autonomously, experiment with ideas, and choose their own tools
- EA must enable deploy-anytime capabilities, with high degrees of automation
- EA and Security must provide developers with preapproved libraries
- Security must be involved from the start and in all phase for of projects
- Security must develop automated tests

#### Measurement

- IT teams must collects data throughout the value stream
- IT teams must established Work In Progress (WIP) limits based on team capacity and cognitive load
- IT teams must make collected data and project status visible to the business
