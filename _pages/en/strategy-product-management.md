## Introduction

### Purpose

To provide the ESDC with a new type of investment: ***Products***[^1].

Phase 1 of the strategy is a 1.5 year Branch Initiative, salary based, to produce an MVP Framework[^2] and evaluate it against 2 product candidates.

### Expected Benefits

Benefits are not realized after a framework is produced, but rather after a series of change management activities have been completed to operationalize and use the framework.
Phase 1's goal is to inform this set of change management activities as a programme-like plan for a Phase 2.

Once realized, we expect the following benefits to ESDC:

1. Increase service improvement cadence
2. Release internal IITB capacity towards innovation
3. Timely prevention of technical debt

### Scope and Target Audience

The scope of this strategy remains within the authorities of the department
(e.g. we are not seeking to change Treasury Board (TB) procedures or laws).

The main Target Audience are the Chief Financial (CFO)[^3] and the Chief Information Officer (CIO)[^4] as the strategy seeks to make modifications in their respective domains.
In addition, we are seeking contributions to teams involved in transformational change management.

A complete list of the stakeholders are listed in Appendix X.

### Disclaimer

![A warning sign](assets/images/warning.png){:style="float: left;vertical-align:middle;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:10%;"}

We are ***NOT*** defining what product management is.

This has already been done[^5].

We are defining ***what needs to change*** to implement it in a government department.
