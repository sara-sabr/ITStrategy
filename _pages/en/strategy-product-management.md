## Introduction

### Purpose

To provide the ESDC with a new type of investment: ***Products***[^1].

Phase 1 of the strategy is a 1.5 year Branch Initiative, salary based, to produce an MVP Framework[^2] and evaluate it against 2 product candidates.

### Expected Benefits

Benefits are not realized after a framework is produced, but rather after a series of change management activities have been completed to operationalize and use the framework.
Phase 1's goal is to inform this set of change management activities as a programme-like plan for a Phase 2.

Once realized, we expect the following benefits to ESDC:

1. Increase service improvement cadence
2. Release internal IITB capacity towards innovation
3. Timely prevention of technical debt

### Scope and Target Audience

The scope of this strategy remains within the authorities of the department
(e.g. we are not seeking to change Treasury Board (TB) procedures or laws).

The main Target Audience are the Chief Financial (CFO)[^3] and the Chief Information Officer (CIO)[^4] as the strategy seeks to make modifications in their respective domains.
In addition, we are seeking contributions to teams involved in transformational change management.

A complete list of the stakeholders are listed in Appendix X.

### Disclaimer

![A warning sign](assets/images/warning.png){:style="float: left;vertical-align:middle;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:10%;"}

We are ***NOT*** defining what product management is.

This has already been done[^5].

We are defining ***what needs to change*** to implement it in a government department.

## Our Definition of "Product"?

***A Software Solution***

(That is, one or more Applications as defined by the [Application Portfolio Management (APM) Program](https://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/OCIO_Application_Portfolio_Management))

A product has clear *Architectural Boundaries* (See Appendix X - Product's architectural boundaries).
A product enables one or more service(s).

We know this is an imperfect definition.
Here is an inventory of 38 known definitions (from industry and government) to further the debate.
For now, please let's start here.

There are three reasons why we chose the above definition:

1. Digital is not about technology. But *doing* Digital requires understanding technology. A definition cannot be so broad that it becomes meaningless to IT[^6],
2. The [Policy on Service and Digital](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32603) sets requirements for the [departmental integrated planning](https://gcconnex.gc.ca/discussion/view/72865810/dpsd-guide-1-0-for-integrated-planning-guide-pmsn-1-0-pour-le-plan-integre?language=en) to identify which application in the APM portfolio is being invested in, and
3. Software has a unique characteristic: its elasticity. This is what Cloud technology gives us and so warrants us to adjusting our planning methods to leverage it.[^7]

## Why We Need This

## Conceptual Product Management Framework

## Phase 1 - Defining the Framework

## Appendix A - Product's Architectural Boundaries

- ***Business Alignment***, to the [Business Capability Model](https://dialogue/grp/EA-AE/SitePages/DBCM.aspx).
- ***Information Profile***, defined by the following attributes:
  - Privacy, manifested by a Privacy Impact Assessment, includes Retention and Disposition rules)
  - Security, manifested by a Statement of Sensitivity and a Statement of Acceptable Risk)
  - Ethics, manifested by one or more Algorithmic Impact Assessment)
- ***Technology Standards***, defined by the following attributes:
  - Unacceptable technical stacks ([in containment or retirement](https://dialogue/grp/CO7397744/Lists/Standards%20Catalogue/AllItems.aspx))

## Appendix - Change Log

## Notes

[^1]: ESDC currently recognizes 3 types of investment: assets, acquired services, and projects (see [ESDC's Guide to building a Business Case](https://gpp-ppm.service.gc.ca/sites/pwa/ESDCKnowledgeRepository/All%20Documents/Guide%20to%20Building%20a%20Business%20Case.pdf))
[^2]: Framework = a directive, a set of standards (e.g. reporting), and a set of procedures (e.g. manoeuvring governance)
[^3]: The main areas of the CFO's domain expertise are Enterprise Project Management, Financial Management, and Investment Performance Management.
[^4]: The main areas of the CIO's domain expertise are Project Managament Office, Release Management (and ITSM), IT Security, and Enterprise Architecture.
[^5]: See [PDMA's Body of Knowledge](https://www.pdma.org/page/npdp-bok-second-edition), [PMI.org](https://www.pmi.org/disciplined-agile/process/product-management), [Info-Tech Research Group](https://www.infotech.com/research/ss/transition-from-project-to-product-delivery), [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/document/3811763), and [ESDC's Digital Experience and Client Data team](https://014gc.sharepoint.com/sites/DECD/SitePages/Delivery-Manual.aspx)
[^6]: In this context, we are not talking about a pharmaceutical drug, a vaccine, a vessel, or a policy document. We are talking about software.
[^7]: Concrete when poored is solid, it cannot be changed. A single 2x4 lumber when cut becomes two 2x4 lumbers. But software can be changed, adapted, and modified with minimal marginal cost (if [well architected](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-architecture)).
