## Employee Profiles

ESDC is a large department (~28 000 employees) of the GC that includes 2 portfolio organizations, the [Labour Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/portfolio/labour.html) and [Service Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/portfolio/service-canada.html).

These profiles are to help categorize employees and determine their IT and business needs when creating a [long term](it-picture-long-term.md) and [medium term](it-picture-medium-term.md) visions as well as strategies to get there.

### Profiles

- Management - Manager and above
- Power users - Development, system/database administration, analytics/reporting
- Client services - Work directly with the public
- General users - Usually at their desk
- Special needs - Non-standard devices and tools

#### Management - Manager and above

Goals:

- End user support to 25,000 employees in 300 locations across the country. Data and analytics services, testing services, environments. Mandate for the department's IT security program.

Habits:

- Work styles: 90% of the time is operations.
- Enabling the productivity of the ESDC Portfolio and our employees by providing them with critical IT support and equipping them with the right devices, information, and software in order to create value for Canadians.
- EO serves as important stewards to ESDC and ensures that when new technology or change is introduced to our ESDC business line that it meets our threshold for excellence through understanding of employee/business expectations.

Needs:

- Need tool for classification. Titus is a market leader but 2 M$ one time without ongoing licensing, so costly
- We already have a DLP tool but useless without classification tool

Problems:

- Productivity drain for ops staff (e.g. processing)
- Stressed network
- Danger of accidental or intentional leak from inside
- But intrusion from outside is not more risk

#### Power users - Development, system/database administration, analytics/reporting

#### Client services - Work directly with the public

Goals:

- Provides seamless, secure, knowledgeable services to Canadians.

Habits:

- Responsible for determining "what" services citizens can expect and "how" these services are delivered and marketed to Canadians through an integrated multi-channel delivery network.
- Working with federal partners to ensure Canadians have access to all programs and services to which they are entitled.
- Leveraging opportunities with other departments to offer citizens a fuller spectrum of government services and information.

Needs:

- As part of the client feedback pilot project, requests have been made to use tablets so our customers can quickly give feedback in a few clicks.
- It helps clerks meet their ‘production quota’ if they are experienced in the work and have a good memory to recall information they need  

Problems:

- Network Latency
- Not mobile – no WIFI – only on Eddy and Phase IV – Difficulty logging into Appfate
- Combined with IRCC/Passport Canada
- At times, ATOM skips over numbers so clients aren’t called in order and they get very angry.
- Printer problems (Xérox)
- IT Services can only be served virtually – takes a long time to receive a response even with a follow-up – the status of the ticket can suddenly be “resolved”  

#### General users - Usually at their desk - IT Advisor

Goals:

- Modernize and increase the efficiency of delivering and maintaining IT Solutions at ESDC
- Influence ESDC IT Strategy and Projects to ensure value to the customer is maximized
- Ensure cohesiveness within the IT space of ESDC

Habits:

- IT guidance and expertise related to all aspects of solution development
- Collaboration with other government entities and external IT partners
- Provide assistance and input into Solution Architectures, IT documentation, Development Processes…

Needs:

- Code analysis and penetration testing
- Environments not setup as production, wastes -> creates false positives
- Security architecture documentations to perform Security assessments (e.g. flows)
  - Reference architectures vetted OK
  - Knowledge of legacy infrastructure/network is lacking
- Encryption and zoning
- Nothing limited adoption of SaaS
  - Integrity of the code (ability to change it) is high priority. E.g. encryption keys, 2 factor.
  - Security Not tied by a product, open to other tools

Problems:

- PoC with JobBank, is being adopted more broadly to IITB
- Limited by licence -> security is owner
- Limited by SSC's VM
- Limited by application teams' practices when they build locally
- Open source vulnerabilities
- App team must have someone dedicated to integrate the security tools in their pipelines

#### General users - Usually at their desk - Non-IT (Business) Advisor

Goals :

- IT guidance and expertise related to all aspects of solution development
- Collaboration with other government entities and external IT partners
- Provide assistance and input into Solution Architectures, IT documentation, Development Processes

Habits:

- BRM managers works with Directors and DGs (both branch and IITB)
- BRM manages relationships so that it doesn't escalate to frustration and anger. It shields the CIO from potential escalation
- BRM can orient IITB personnel to find answers.
- BRM works very closely with EA. BRM works with the client to ensure the partner

Needs:

- Proactively reach out to clients to find their pain points. BRM sit in their management meetings (if they are invited). To present the voice of IITB.
- BRM needs to keep in the loop when engagement with IITB and branches is established. So they are aware of progress, potential difficulties, and topics of discussion. Perfect thing would be a weekly report (similar to ESDC Innovation Lab).
- Manages relationships so that it doesn't escalate to frustration and anger. It shields the CIO from potential escalation

Problems:

- IT stakeholders don’t believe in customer focus or believe there is a limit to how far they should go to satisfy customers
- Competing priorities: IT priorities vs. business priorities
- Fiscal restraints: Always trying to do more with fewer resources
- Having the IT capacity and resources to do a job/project and/or finding the right balance between capacity and resources
- Balancing and managing multiple accounts—everyone feels important
How do you give everyone the maximum attention when you have to manage more than one account?
- No direct or positional authority over the IT department

#### Special needs - Non-standard devices and tools
