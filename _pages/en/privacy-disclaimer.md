We use the [default implementation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11593727?hl=en) of Google Analytics.

We use Google Analytics to mainly get insights on which pages are being visited and who visits our sites.

This means Google collects the following information from your visit:

- Which pages you visited
- What browser and device you used to visit them
- Approximate geolocation of where you were when visiting them
