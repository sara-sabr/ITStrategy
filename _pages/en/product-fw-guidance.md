    <p>
This document <strong>does NOT</strong> attempt to explain all aspects of Product Management (such as vision setting, user research, and the different phases a product goes through in its life cycle).
These are well documented already, such as on <a href="https://www.pmi.org/disciplined-agile/process/product-management">PMI.org</a> and <a href="https://community.pdma.org/knowledgehub/home">PDMA.org</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Instead, this documents seeks to provide structure to ESDC Programs and IITB in the <strong>transition</strong> from project to product, <strong>within a government context</strong>.
    In particular, the rationale and methods to <strong>cross-functional and cross-branch product teams</strong>.

## Narative

This section provides context and describes the causal relationship between the elements of the Directive (rules to follow), its associated Standard (more detailed rules such as formats and specific information required), and their expected outcomes.
Job Bank is used as an example.

Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) provides multiples services via its [50 Programs](https://dialogue/grp/WG6278300/SitePages/Performance%20Information%20Profiles.aspx) to [improve the standard of living and quality of life for all Canadians](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development.html).
One of those Programs is Job Bank.

Products can be tied to Service delivery, then to Programs the following way.
