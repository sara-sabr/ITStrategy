## Content

On this website, you will find our work in progress, list of reference material and our presentations.

It's all work in progress and changes continuously and it's meant to make it easily navigable for anyone to see what we're working on.

If you're interested in actually looking at the workspace itself, join us on our [project repository](https://github.com/sara-sabr/ITStrategy) on GitHub.
You can create issues, participate in discussions and even contribute!

We've also set up a few CI tests in order to keep our content clean but also to showcase how powerful these open collaboration tools can be to maintain a project, whether it is simple text files or source code.
