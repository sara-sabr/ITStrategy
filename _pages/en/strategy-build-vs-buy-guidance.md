## Context

This document is complementary content for the [Build vs Buy Strategy](strategy-build-vs-buy.html).

## Checklist

When deciding whether an IT Product should be bought, configured, assembled, or built, the following checklist helps provide a high level guidance as to what is the best course of action:

- Is the capability being sought a core function of your department?
  - Is it required to deliver on the departments mandate?
- Is there is a standing GC Wide contract in place for a given product or service that meets the needs?
- Are there existing open source solutions available that meet the same need?
- Are there existing open source solutions that could be easily modified which meet the same need?
- Are requirements of the surrounding processes likely to change due to changes in laws, directions, governance, or processes?
- Is the functionality of the solution not extendable through the use of APIs using common protocols (e.g.: REST, GraphQL, etc.)

This list is not exhaustive and a proper solutions architecture is required in choosing the best path forward.

Failure to take into consideration the flexibility, interoperability and interchangeability when sourcing or renewing core to mandate IT Solutions may lead to lock-in situations as well as increased difficulty in adapting to future changes needed to offer ESDC's services to Canadians.
