## Introduction

### Purpose

To provide IITB with modern and supported **Version Control Systems (VCS)** for use in software projects, and a roadmap to get there.

This strategy is aimed at reducing the need to support various legacy version control systems, while increasing the collaboration and visibility between projects within ESDC, across the GC and publicly.

The strategy includes:

1. A **Guiding Policy**, which serves to set automatic decisions that defines the expected usage of the version control systems
2. A **Coherent set of actions** (an action plan), which serve to operationalize the version control systems

The intent behind this strategy is to communicate a decision by the CIO (not yet approved) on a path forward (the Guiding Policy), and what investments are needed to operationalize that decision (the coherent set of actions).

### Target Audience

This **strategy document** is targeted to stakeholders involved in determining how IT Products are delivered.
More specifically, stakeholders involved in defining the rules for building, delivering, operationalizing, and maintaining IT Products.
The stakeholders are listed in section [Coherent set of actions](#coherent-set-of-actions) and are expected to participate in the execution stage of this strategy necessary to operationalize the Guiding Policy.

The **Guiding Policy**, once operationalized, will define the default systems where ESDC IITB will publish and maintain its source code, scripts, and system/database configurations.
All ESDC personnel involved in the management of IT Products is expected to adhere to this policy, including but not limited to, development and operations staff.

### Business Case

Moving to the digital age requires improving IT's responsiveness.

To improve IT's responsiveness, we must find ways to reduce risks associated with its use.
This strategy proposes equipping ESDC with a set of **modern and supported Version Control Systems**, for use by all software-related projects, and in direct support with [GC Digital Standards](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html), [ESDC Open Source Software (OSS) Management Framework (internal)](https://dialogue/grp/TAWS-ATST/Collaboration%20Architecture%20Services/Projects/Artificial%20Intelligence%20and%20Open%20Source/OSS/ESDC%20Open%20Source%20Management%20Framework%20v%201.1.docx) and <a href="strategy-target-solution-delivery-model.html">ESDC Target IT Solution Delivery Model strategy (in consultation)</a>.
The benefits for the organization are numerous:

#### Benefits <!-- omit in toc -->

- Reduce development **costs** through collaboration and platform consolidation;
- Strengthen **relationships** between IT and business through a common platform;
- **Find, discover, reuse and share** code quickly and efficiently across GC departments;
- Enhance **planning and tracking** of feature development through a single view;
- **Accelerate** development and deployment cycles;
- Increase software **transparency**;
- Improve the **quality and security** of code through continuous automated testing and external contributions (by working in the open);
- Ensure compliance with **Information Management** policies with lifecycle management;
- Attract IT **talent**;
- Reduce vendor **lock-in** by increasing capacity to support source code; and
- Obtain metrics/statistics for **reporting** and continuous improvement.

The Architecture Review Committee (ARC) already endorsed the usage of 3 version control systems in [July 2019 (internal presentation)](https://dialogue/proj/ITCD-RMTI/SAS-SAS/Documents/Services/Projects/GC%20Code/ARC%20Presentation%20on%20GCCode%20Governance.pptx):

- [GitHub](https://github.com): Share with public (Unclassified);
- [GCcode (internal)](https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca): Share with GC (up to Protected A); and
- [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/devops/): Share within ESDC (up to Protected B).

However, work remains in some areas to drive adoption.
For instance, GCcode is not officially supported by SSC and lack some modern DevOps features (such as deployment to external cloud providers).
This strategy's goal is to define what the target state of the version control systems should be, and provide a roadmap in getting to this target state.

This strategy complements existing IT initiatives, such as [ESDC IITB Way Forward](http://dialogue/grp/IITB-DGIIT-Gov-New-Nouveau/Documents/Departmental%20IMIT%20Plan/19-20%20Plans/IITB%20Moving%20Forward%20v2.docx), and supports them with new activities (see [Coherent set of actions](#coherent-set-of-actions)).

## Guiding Policy

The following policy reflects the decision adopted by the **CIO of ESDC** (approval by CIO not yet obtained) regarding usage of the Version Control Systems.
Each policy statement is a declaration of that decision and has received the endorsement of its associated area of governance body (endorsements not yet obtained, see [Coherent set of actions](#coherent-set-of-actions)).

This policy becomes active when IT Products are to be built.
Once active, all teams involved in the project, and the IT products involved in the IT solution, must comply with this guiding policy.

This Guiding Policy has been prepared by taking into consideration alignment and compliance with existing policy instruments and does not replace them.
Stakeholders are expected to still comply with existing policy instruments including, but not limited to:

- TBS [Directive on Service and Digital](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32601)
- TBS [Directive on Security Management](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32611)
- ESDC Information Management Policy (being drafted)
- ESDC Security Policy (being drafted)

### Development and Operations Teams (incl. SSC) <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Use a DevOps platform with a Git-based Version Control System (VCS) among the following options, in that order of preference:
   - Public (Unclassified): **[GitHub](https://github.com)** or another [approved public platform (internal)](https://dialogue/grp/TAWS-ATST/Technology_Standards/Brick%20Repository/Software%20Version%20and%20Source%20Code%20Management.mht)
   - Interdepartmental (up to Protected A): **[GCcode (internal)](https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca)**
   - Internal (up to Protected B): **[Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/devops/)**
2. Follow the guidance of [ESDC Open Source Software (OSS) Management Framework (internal)](https://dialogue/grp/TAWS-ATST/Collaboration%20Architecture%20Services/Projects/Artificial%20Intelligence%20and%20Open%20Source/OSS/ESDC%20Open%20Source%20Management%20Framework%20v%201.1.docx).
3. Leverage the functionalities provided by the selected VCS as much as possible, for instance:
    - File hosting (source code, scripts, system/database configurations...);
    - Issues (incl. milestones and Kanban);
    - Wiki (documentation);
    - Build and Test Automation (e.g., security-related); and
    - Deployment to internal or external platforms.
4. Make their projects in the VCS open by default, including for contributions.
5. Adhere to best practices defined in ESDC OSS Management Framework and GC [Guide for Publishing Open Source Code](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/open-source-software/guide-for-publishing-open-source-code.html), such as:
    - Project space is easily discoverable;
    - There's a clear process to support and encourage external contributions (other employees, public);
    - Code of conduct is present;
    - Security disclosure process is in place for vulnerabilities;
    - Documentation (at least minimal) is published and maintained, and translated at each release (TBD);
    - Classified information and secrets are kept in proper tools and never hardcoded in the source code;
    - Source code security and compliance is automatically assessed on a continuous basis with tools and services; and
    - An up-to-date bill of materials is continuously generated and made available.

## Measuring the Strategy's success

This Strategy's success will be measured by tracking the following metrics of VCS usage:

1. *Number of projects and users (compared to total)*
2. *Percentage of team's code, configuration or scripts stored*
3. *How easily and quickly can teams leverage VCS in their work (high, medium, low)*
4. *Level of activity of projects (issues, commits, deployments, etc. - high, medium, low)*
5. *User Satisfaction (high, medium, low)*

*Manual*: the collection of data requires manual intervention (e.g., surveys, interviews, emails, spreadsheet updates).

*Automatic*: the collection of data is performed automatically, usually involving programmatic means (e.g., events triggered by a Git repository when a new commit is performed, which updates a master dashboard “view”).

Some of the metrics are based on [DORA DevOps Research](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-tech-version-control#ways_to_measure_version_control).

## Appendix B - Definitions

**Version Control System (VCS)**  
There are 2 types of VCS:

Centralized:  
VCS are based on the idea that there is a single “central” copy of a software project somewhere (most likely on a server), and developers make code changes directly on this central copy.

Distributed:  
VCS (DVCS) do not necessarily rely on a central server to store all the versions of a software project's files.
Instead, every developer “clones” a copy of a repository and has the full history of the project on its own hard drive.
This copy (or “clone”) has all of the metadata of the original.
In a DVCS, developers typically will make code changes on their local copy, test them on their local copy, and “push” them to a central server containing the “master” copy the software project is intended to use.

**IT Solution**  
An IT Solution is the combination of 1 or many IT Products, which are in turn comprised of 1 or many Software and/or Hardware, obtained through many possible ways: built internally, obtained as open source, provided by a company as an executable application under a proprietary licence, as a standalone device, or used as a service through a subscription model.

**IT Product**  
The combination of software, infrastructure, and their configuration.
An IT Product is akin to an “application” as defined by the [Application Portfolio Management (APM)](https://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/OCIO_Application_Portfolio_Management) program.
An IT Product may have one or many software (e.g., COTS, open source libraries, open source software, custom-built software).
Each of those software are deployed in one or many infrastructure (on premise, on the public cloud, or a combination of the two making it a hybrid deployment).
For the scope of this Strategy, Operating Systems are NOT defined as IT products.
Therefore should an IT Product depend on an Operating System to run in production, it is in compliance with this Guiding Policy.
