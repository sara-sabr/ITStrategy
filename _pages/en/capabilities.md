## High Performing IT Capabilities

A DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) [Quick Check of software delivery performance in ESDC and IITB](https://beta.devops-research.com/performance.html?leadtime=1&deployfreq=1&ttr=3&chgfail=4&industry=government) show that we are low performers for deployment frequency, lead time for changes, time to restore service and change fail rate.

The [State of DevOps Report](https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops/) has been published annually since 2014, as part of the DORA, a six-year research program that has validated a number of technical, process, measurement, and cultural [capabilities to drive higher software delivery and organizational performance](https://cloud.google.com/devops/#devops-capabilities).

IITB and ESDC must continuously improve these capabilities:

### Technical

- Version control
- Continuous integration
- Deployment automation
- Trunk-based development
- Test automation
- Architecture
- Empowering teams to choose tools
- Test data management
- Shifting left on security

### Process

- Team experimentation
- Streamlining change approval
- Customer feedback
- Visibility of work in the value stream
- Working in small batches

### Measurement

- Monitoring systems to inform business decisions
- Proactive failure notification
- Work in process limits
- Visual management capabilities

### Cultural

- Job satisfaction
- Westrum organizational culture
- Learning culture
