## Alignment with ESDC IT Strategy

This Strategy aligns with the [ESDC IT Strategy approach](esdc-it-strategy.html) and provides the means to enable the following 2 [Strategy Map](strategy-summary.html) capabilities:

1. Learning Culture
2. Continuous Improvement

## Guiding Policy

IITB teams should **use up to 20% of the team's time to improve and learn**

## Expected Outcomes

The expected outcomes of this quarterly strategy are:

- Reduction of technical debt
- Increased innovation
- Faster response to needs of citizens
- Faster response to operational issues (e.g.: new vulnerabilities)
- Reduced frequency of incidents and errors
- Increased ability to comply with regulations
- Increased job satisfaction and retention (incl. student)
- Culture resistant to potential disruptions via automation
- Culture that benefits from automation opportunities

## Set of actions

To operationalize this strategy, the following set of actions will be undertaken been taken:

1. (completed) Creation of a new CATS code for teams to record their times (**14644**) in addition to existing ones
2. (completed) Creation of a [Learning Resource Directory](references-en.html#q1-strategy---continuous-improvement-and-learning) to help employees find recommended avenues for learning
3. (completed) Provide [examples of improvements and learning activities](#appendix-a---examples-of-activities)
4. (in progress) Creation of an intuitive tool for staff to share anecdotal success & failure stories to share knowledge
5. (do do) Creation of a [Tool for crowd sourcing learning](https://github.com/sara-sabr/ITStrategy/milestone/45)

Please note that \#4 and \#5 are not necessarily to operationalize this strategy, but will facilitate its success.

## Measuring this strategy

IITB teams are asked to report on the strategy as they implement it in the two following ways:

**IITB employees can ensure that time that they spend on continuous improvement or learning activities is recorded in CATS** using any of the following:

- CATS codes for Continuous Improvement activities:
  - **Continuous improvement:** 14644
  - **Grassroots innovation:** 13671
  - **IM Clean-up:** 10165
  - **Improving developer productivity:** 13863

- CATS codes for Learning activities:
  - **Career development:** 10600
  - **IT Security training for IITB:** 10608
  - **Accessibility training and awareness:** 13403
  - **Official language training:** 11500
  - **General training:** task component code 330 or task component code 100
  - **Task specific training:** task component code 160
  
AND/OR

**IITB employees/teams can share success/failure stories with the IT Strategy team** and this anecdotal evidence will be recorded and shared.

The results of employee/team reporting will be shared via a [Report](http://dialogue/grp/BU6810070/Shared%20Documents/cont%20improvement%20and%20learning%20-%20April%201st%202019%20to%20Feb%2029%202020_report.xlsx) (link is internal to ESDC).

This strategy will be reviewed and updated quarterly based on effectiveness and current progress towards the [Medium Term IT Picture - 2025](https://sara-sabr.github.io/ITStrategy/it-picture-medium-term.html) as well as following the [Strategy Map](https://sara-sabr.github.io/ITStrategy/strategy-summary.html) (layering on the strategies).
