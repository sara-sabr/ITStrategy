## Purpose

To elaborate on the re-usable methods the IT Strategy team will have at its disposal in communicating effectively its strategies to various audiences.

## Objectives

The objectives of the team's communication strategy are to:

- Raise awareness of IT Strategies being produced and approved to ESDC personnel, more specifically IITB ones
- Engage effectively with stakeholders during both the strategy making process and their execution
- Demonstrate the success of IT strategies
- Ensure stakeholders understand the intent of the IT strategies
- Change behaviours and perceptions where necessary

## Stakeholders, and Key Messages

_Stakeholders_ represent the type of audience the team is looking to target, and what _messages_ this audience will be targetted with based on our understanding of what they need to know.

## Operational Approach

As the team is taking an interative approach to strategy making, the following communication work will occure **every quarter** (an image would be ideal here):

1. Seek endorsement and approval of quarterly strategy(ies)
2. Perform outreach to community of targetted stakeholders
3. Measuring and communicating progress update to targetted stakeholders

The type of stakeholder to target will depend on the type of strategy to endorse and execute.

The above communication work will require to keep a consistent message to stakeholders in order to avoid confusion and maintain credibility of the team's approach.

## Evaluation

How will we measure ourselves on whether our communication strategy works or needs to be adjusted?
KPIs should be closely related to objectives but can also be used to support results in our actions. E.g.

- Number of hits on our website
- Number of endorsements received
- Number of forum events the team presented at
- Number of attendance at those forum events
- Number of feedbacks received as part of the Feedback loop Communications method
- Number of twitter retweets from CIO/IITB stakeholders
