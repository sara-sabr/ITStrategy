## Communications Strategy

- [Purpose](#purpose)
- [Stakeholders](#stakeholders)
- [Communications Methods](#communications-methods)
- [Evaluation](#evaluation)

### Purpose

To elaborate on the reusable methods the IT Strategy team will have at its disposal to communicate effectively its strategies.
The goals of the communication strategy are to:

- Engage effectively with stakeholders during both the strategy making process and its execution
- Ensure stakeholders understand the intent of the IT strategies
- Raise awareness of IT Strategies being produced and approved for ESDC personnel, more specifically IITB
- Change behaviours and perceptions where necessary
- Demonstrate the success of IT strategies

### Stakeholders

- IITB Senior Executives (DG and ADM)
- IITB Executives (Directors and Executive Directors)
- IITB Management (Managers and Team Leads)
- IITB Workforce
- Non-IITB ESDC executives (e.g., Business)
- General ESDC or other Government department personnel

#### Key Messages

For each Stakeholder, we need to identify the key messages (objective we want) they will need to hear from our Team.
For example:

- IITB Senior Executives
  - General direction, endorsements, and progress updates towards that direction via identified metrics
- IITB Management
  - Staffing-related and management-related strategies (e.g. continuous learning objectives)
- IITB Workforce
  - Daily actions they can start doing today, tools at their disposal, forums at their disposal

Link to the "Communications Methods" at our disposal that can be used.

### Communications Methods

- [Endorsement](#endorsement)
- [Outreach](#outreach)
- [Feedback](#feedback)

#### Endorsement

To be official, strategies, actions and other initiatives, must be endorsed or approved by management (DG, CIO, DM, ..).
The following are ways to get things endorsed.

##### CIO Executive Committee

Requires wider consultation and presentation to DG Committee.
Use for quarterly strategies and actions as well as other changes that require wider consultation.

Follow these steps:

1. Director feedback/updates
1. Other teams feedback/updates
   - Security
   - Operations
   - Development
   - Databases
   - Learning
   - ..
1. DG feedback/updates
1. Present to DG Committee
1. Present to Architecture Review Committee
1. Present to CIO Executive Committee
1. Published on Intranet

##### Briefing Note

Can be sent directly to DG, CIO or DM, using organization reporting structure (hierarchy).
Use for information or to avoid going up through committees for Endorsement.

#### Outreach

Quarterly strategies and actions will start on 2020-04-01.
Every 3 months the strategies and actions will be updated based on feedback and progress.
New strategies and actions will be added based on strategy map (layer on the strategies).
The following are ways to get things outreached.

##### Emails

- Email from CIO about upcoming changes (quarterly strategies, SaaS access)
- Quarterly emails from DG about strategies and actions
- IITB Newsletter

##### Presentations

- SLF, MTLC, ..
- IITB Showcase, Dev CoP, GC DevOps League, ..

##### Blogs

- IT Strategy Website
- IITB Blog
- Linkedin
- Twitter

#### Feedback

Feedback will inform how we move forward with quarterly strategies and actions as well as other initiatives.

- Short quarterly surveys about strategies and actions
- Gather feedback at presentations

### Evaluation

How will we measure ourselves on whether our communication strategy works or needs to be adjusted?
KPIs should be closely related to objectives but can also be used to support results in our actions. E.g.:

- Number of hits on our website
- Number of endorsements received
- Number of forum events the team presented at
- Number of attendance at those forum events
- Number of comments received as part of the feedback loop
- Number of Twitter retweets from CIO/IITB stakeholders
