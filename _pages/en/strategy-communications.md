### Purpose

To elaborate on the re-usable methods the IT Strategy teams will have at their disposal in communicate effectively its strategies.
The goals of the communication strategy are:

- Raise awareness of IT Strategies being produced and approved to ESDC personnel, more specifically IITB ones
- Engage effectively with stakeholders during both the strategy making process and their execution
- Demonstrate the success of IT strategies
- Ensure stakeholders understand the intent of the IT strategies
- Change behaviours and perceptions where necessary

### Stakeholders

- IITB Senior Executives (DG and ADM)
- IITB Executives (Directors and Executive Directors)
- IITB Management (Managers and Team Leads)
- IITB Workforce
- Non-IITB ESDC executives (e.g. "The Business")
- General ESDC or other Government department personnel

#### Key Messages

For each Stakeholders, we need to identify the key messages (objective we want) they will need to hear from our Team.
For example:

- IITB Senior Executives
  - General Direction, Endorsements, and progress updates towards that direction via Identified Metrics
- IITB Management
  - Staffing-related and Management-related strategies (e.g. continuous learning objectives)
- IITB Workforce
  - Daily actions they can start doing today, tools at their disposal, forums at their disposal

Link to the "Communications Methods" at our disposal that can be used.

### Communications Methods

- [Endorsement](#endorsement)
- [Outreach](#outreach)
- [Feedback](#feedback)

#### Endorsement

To be official, strategies, actions and other initiatives, must be endorsed or approved by management (DG, CIO, DM, ..).
The following are way to get things endorsed.

Follow these steps:

1. Director Feedback/updates

#### Feedback

Feedback will inform how we move forward with quarterly strategies and actions as well as other initiatives.

- Short quarterly surveys about strategies and actions
- Gather feedback at presentations

### Evaluation

How will we measure ourselves on whether our communication strategy works or needs to be adjusted?
KPIs should be closely related to objectives but can also be used to support results in our actions. E.g.

- Number of hits on our website
- Number of endorsements received
- Number of forum events the team presented at
- Number of attendance at those forum events
- Number of feedbacks received as part of the Feedback loop Communications method
- Number of twitter retweets from CIO/IITB stakeholders
