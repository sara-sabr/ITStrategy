## Purpose

To elaborate iterative process of soliciting the knowledge, experience judgement and values of wide range of different shareholders

## Objectives

The objectives of the team's communication strategy are to:

- Enhance identity and maintaining relationships with stakeholders during both the strategy making process and its execution
- Ensure stakeholders understand the intent of the IT strategies
- Raise awareness of IT Strategies being produced and approved for ESDC personnel, more specifically IITB
- Educate, train, change behaviours and perceptions where necessary
- Highlight the success of IT strategies

## Stakeholders, and Key Messages

_Stakeholders_ represent the type of audience the team plan to engage and collaborate in its strategic business processes, and what  _messages_  this audience will be introduced based on our understanding of their expectations and interests.

## Operational Approach

As the team is taking an iterative approach to strategy making, the following communication work will occur **every quarter** (an image would be ideal here):

1. Seek endorsement and approval of quarterly strategy(ies)
2. Perform outreach to community of targeted stakeholders
3. Measuring and communicating progress update to targeted stakeholders

The type of stakeholder to target will depend on the type of strategy to endorse and execute.

The above communication work will require to make relevant and transparent messages to the wide group of stakeholders in order to increase accountability, build and maintain credibility in the department.

### Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) Teams

Subject Matter Teams may be involved when endorsements from specific subject matters are required.
Endorsements from those subject matter teams may be obtained via peer reviews or presentations followed by email endorsements.

2. Dispose of comments by making changes to the draft document, and record both the comment and the disposition (accepted, dismissed, modified)
3. Re-send the updated draft document for final review. Provide a feedback deadline
4. If no breaking changes, finalize the document

Peer Reviews are meant to track feedback received, and the disposition of those feedback.
A record of those feedbacks and dispositions must be kept (so if senior management asks what team X said about a strategy, we can show them)

### Briefing Note

Use for information or to avoid going up through committees for Endorsement.

### Custom Metrics

Feedback will inform how we move forward with quarterly strategies and actions as well as other initiatives.

## Evaluation

How will we measure ourselves on whether our communication strategy works or needs to be adjusted?
KPIs should be closely related to objectives but can also be used to support results in our actions. E.g.:

- Number of hits on our website
- Number of endorsements received
- Number of forum events the team presented at
- Number of attendance at those forum events
- Number of comments received as part of the feedback loop
- Number of Twitter retweets from CIO/IITB stakeholders
