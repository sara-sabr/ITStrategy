## Purpose

To elaborate on the re-usable methods the IT Strategy team will have at its disposal in communicating effectively its strategies to various audiences

## Objectives

The objectives of the team's communication strategy are to:

- Enhance identity and maintaining relationships with stakeholders during both the strategy making process and its execution

- Educate, train, change behaviours and perceptions where necessary

## Stakeholders, and Key Messages

_Stakeholders_ represent key assets to engage and collaborate in our strategic business processes, and what  _messages_  this audience will be introduced based on our understanding of their expectations and interests.

## Operational Approach

As the team is taking an iterative approach to strategy making, the following communication work will occur **every quarter** (an image would be ideal here):

1. Seek endorsement and approval of quarterly strategy(ies)
2. Perform outreach to community of targeted stakeholders
3. Measuring and communicating progress update to targeted stakeholders

The engagement with stakeholders will depend on their level of involvement in making and implementing our strategies.

The above communication work will require to make relevant and transparent messages to the wide group of stakeholders in order to increase accountability, build and maintain credibility in the department.

- Number of forum events the team presented at
- Number of attendance at those forum events
- Number of comments received as part of the feedback loop
- Number of Twitter retweets from CIO/IITB stakeholders
