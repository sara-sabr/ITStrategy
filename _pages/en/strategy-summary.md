## {{ page.title }}

This is our strategy map that shows the capabilities that IITB and ESDC need to continuously improve as well as the evolution towards the government as a service (OneGC) vision included in the [Digital Operations Strategic Plan: 2018-2022](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-operations-strategic-plan-2018-2022.html) and the [Policy on Service and Digital](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32603).

The links current lead to the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) [DevOps Capabilities](https://cloud.google.com/devops/#devops-capabilities).
Links will be updated to point to specific strategies and theories of change (how will changes occur in IT teams) for each capability.
