The IT Strategy team at ESDC is currently looking at the possibility of launching a  micro-procurement pilot as part of a broader IT sourcing strategy.

## Background

The GC Developers Exchange (GCDevEx) was originally launched in 2017.
It was a website to facilitate micro-procurement in the GC.
All contract opportunities were for open source code and had a value of $10K or less.
Contractors did not need security clearance as all work was unclassified and virtual.
One of the main goals of the GC Developers Exchange was to distribute GC contract dollars to those who might not normally get them (e.g., students, small companies, those not in the National Capital Region).
The initiative was originally inspired by the BC Developers Exchange, which as evolved into the [Digital Marketplace](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/marketplace) offering opportunities up to $70K (and even $2M for supplying an Agile Team).

For more info, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/canada-ca/devex) and this [Canadian Government Executive article](https://canadiangovernmentexecutive.ca/dig/24_03/28/).

## Status of the pilot at ESDC

Our investigations have included the following so far:

### Talking to Procurement experts

One of the challenges with iteration 1.0 of GCDevEx was that the backend procurement processes did not change.
 For the ESDC micro-procurement pilot we would want to see streamlined procurement process with more automation and less time between describing the need and getting the work done.
To that end, we have been connecting with procurement subject matter experts at ESDC, PSPC and the Canadian Digital Service.
We have developed a [deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1guX117_Cl6vGrfGb8E8En5gLLzjJDLFBxnJR1whDb-w/edit?usp=sharing) to provide some background prior to these conversations.
 These discussions are helping us to frame our [problem statement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dpsXvXY_iHsgJAAPQzrX8gOhm5ttC_JCCGZKvWRWQZk/edit) to understand whether a micro-procurement initiative is the right solution to help with procurement innovation in IT.

### Capturing use cases

Do you have a need for rapid procurement? Do you have work packages you could put out for procurement that could be done for $10K or less? We are meeting with folks to ask these questions.
If you are interested in sharing your thoughts (even if you wouldn't use it and you want to tell us why), then get in touch!  We can be reached by [email](mailto:EDSC.DGIIT.StrategieTI-ITStrategy.IITB.ESDC@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca).
For some examples of [Micro-procurement use cases](https://github.com/canada-ca/devex/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+%2410K+project+idea), check out the ones Mike Gifford documented back in 2018 and recently updated them to identify those that are still needed.

### Thinking about the technical aspects

Since GCDevEx was last online, the BCDevExchange has become the [BC Digital Marketplace](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/marketplace). The code for this marketplace is openly available on the [Digital Marketplace repository](https://github.com/bcgov/digital_marketplace) on GitHub.

We are currently investigating at a high level, whether ESDC should fork the BC Digital Marketplace code and also what the solution architecture could look like if ESDC were to launch a micro-procurement initiative.

### Documenting what would be needed to operationalize

Operationalizing micro-procurement in the GC is not as simple as standing up an application.
 Working with departmental procurement teams on a streamlined process is the bulk of the work.
Once it is up and running, a product owner will be required, as well as people to provide ongoing technical support.
 Support would also be required to help GC employees write and run their opportunities as well as support to vendors who could need help responding to opportunities.
 The BC Developers Exchange is a great example when considering the number of people required to make a micro-procurement platform run.
 We are currently documenting the [operational needs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11CQBSzSRiVCzzoM6_uYrVu8p-CgWEzKkgaq9FLW1Xm4/edit?usp=sharing) of a possible reboot of the GC Developers Exchange.

### Other government organizations who have experimented with micro-procurement

- The BC Government runs the  [Digital Marketplace](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/marketplace), previously led by the team from the  [BC Developers Exchange](https://bcdevexchange.org)
- The US government via 18F launched the Micro-Purchase platform in 2015.
For more info: description of their [micro-purchasing experiment](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/10/13/open-source-micropurchasing/), and this [blog post](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/01/15/micro-purchase-auctions-round-2-what-we-learned/) of their lessons learned)

### Now is a good time to consider running a micro-procurement pilot at ESDC

- The [Internal Blueprint 2020 Red Tape Reduction Report](https://internal-red-tape-reduction-report.github.io) was recently posted online which highlights low dollar value procurement as an area of opportunity for red-tape reduction
- [GC policy instruments](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32602#claA.2.3.8) direct GC developers to use open standards and solutions by default.
- Many folks are currently unemployed or underemployed (including students) due to COVID
- Virtual work allows maintaining of physical distancing and positions folks to work asynchronously (e.g., around child care)
- The work ties into the IT Strategy team's mandate to find and solve problems!
- Micro-procurement could help with the adoption of open source software
- Micro-procurement could be especially useful for those working in an agile or iterative way
