## 1. Document Purpose

To document the areas of concerns between stakeholders involved in the Alternate IT Solution Delivery Model Strategy.

Why?

With that many stakeholders involved in the elaboration of the strategy, consensus is unlikely. Choices will have to be made in order to keep moving forward. Those choices may contradict a stakeholder’s feedback and position. To maintain transparency amongst stakeholders and to the authority of this strategy (expected to be the CIO), a list of those choices regarding NOT addressing some feedback/positions in the strategy will be kept.

This document serves two purposes:

1. To ensure stakeholders’ valuable feedback is not lost through the elaboration of the strategy
2. To summarize the areas of concerns raised during the multiple peer reviews
3. To document the justifications for choosing a particular direction

## 2. Areas of concerns

### 2.1. IT Solutions that spans more than one project

#### 2.1.1. Summary

One IT solution may span more than one project and include work involved to satisfy multiple project objectives. For example, data management is a capability that crosses multiple project initiative and is required as part of the architecture, design, and implementation of an IT solutions.

How to manage and keep track of such cross-project work?

#### 2.1.2. Raised by stakeholder(s)

- Enterprise Architecture
- Chief Data Office

#### 2.1.3. What is being done about this concern

- Exploring the use of Senior Advisor’s model for OAS-SIS (using Squads, PO, Chief PO, Project Owner). The idea is that Lines of Businesses would be the POs and Project Owners. They would coordinate changes to IT Products downstreams and prioritize them, sharing part of the accountability on IT Projects.

### 2.2. Proliferation of IT standards

#### 2.2.1. Summary

Allowing DevOps teams to choose their technical stacks negates the principle of standard and could proliferate technologies across the enterprise, making it more costly and risky for ESDC to sustain their long-term operations, maintenance, and sustainability.

#### 2.2.2. Raised by stakeholder(s)

- Technical Architecture
- Solution Architecture
- Enterprise Architecture

#### 2.2.3. What is being done about this concern

Pending resolution. Ideas around:

- IT Projects are capped at $2.5M, limiting the ability of a project sponsor to fund an expensive IT product (e.g., proprietary product)
- Promoting the adoption of OSS instead
- Enterprise Architecture and Solution Architecture at IT Project inception identifying reusable components to be in scope of IT solution for the IT Project
- DevOps teams would still require to go through procurement processes should they want to procure a proprietary solution or support agreement.

### 2.3. Financials for IT Products’ evolution (lifecycle management)

#### 2.3.1. Summary

We cannot tax financials to a project once it is closed. Yet, software maintenance is not just operational costs, it’s managing the technical debt and its evolution from end-user feedback without the burden of creating projects.

#### 2.3.2. Raised by stakeholder(s)

- BPMO
- IT Strategy
- Innovation

#### 2.3.3. What is being done about this concern

TBD as it needs involvement with Financial and Investment Advisors.

The current thought is to budget the IT Project with a lifecycle amount, as a condition to start an IT Project.

### 2.4. Managing this strategy initiative to completion

#### 2.4.1. Summary

Once the Strategy is approved, who will Project Manage the list of initiatives, coordinating and following up with the respective teams to see the strategy to completion?

#### 2.4.2. Raised by stakeholder(s)

- CCoE
- IT Strategy
- BPMO

#### 2.4.3. What is being done about this concern

### 2.5. Oversight on IT Product changes (PO, PM, discretionary, and technical debt)

#### 2.5.1. Summary

The strategy looks at enabling IT Product changes without the burden of having lines of business going through a project lifecycle. It is currently expected that Product Owners would be managing the priorities for an IT Product backlog that DevOps team (with the Product Manager) executes.

However, if the Product Owner is from the line of business, it will challenge timely management of technical debt due to its technical nature that a line of business would not see or expected to comprehend.

In addition, some while some features are non-discretionary (e.g., legal requirements) others are (e.g., user interface changes). While there needs to be oversight to track effort allocation, it’s unclear how this oversight would not create a different but equal type of burden than that of creating a project.

#### 2.5.2. Raised by stakeholder(s)

- Senior Advisors
- Innovation
- BPMO
- IT Strategy

#### 2.5.3. What is being done about this concern

TBD

### 2.6. Approach to IT Capacity planning

#### 2.6.1. Summary

With moving towards a more agile method of working, that is having Product Owners and Development teams communicating directly and allowed to make changes to their IT Products, how will IITB manage its IT capacity planning?

#### 2.6.2. Raised by stakeholder(s)

- BPMO

#### 2.6.3. What is being done about this concern

Moving towards funding teams, instead of set of individuals that comes from different cost centres.

Ensure the following actions address this concern:

3\. set of Coherent Action / Governance / Produce a Policy guidance document activity

3.set of Coherent Action / Governance / IITB Agile Governance Framework

### 2.7. Alignment and Gap analysis with Policy and Directive (Investment & Project Management)

#### 2.7.1. Summary

An analysis needs to take place to highlight if this model is in alignment with:

- ESDC [Directive on Project Management](https://gpp-ppm.service.gc.ca/sites/pwa/ESDCKnowledgeRepository/All%20Documents/Directive%20on%20Project%20Management.pdf)
- ESDC [Directive on Programme Management](https://gpp-ppm.service.gc.ca/sites/pwa/ESDCKnowledgeRepository/All%20Documents/Directive%20On%20Programme%20Management.pdf)
- ESDC Policy on Project and Programme Management (PPPM)
- TBS [Directive on the Management of Projects and Programme](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32594)
- TBS [Policy on Planning and Management of Investments](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32593)

#### 2.7.2. Raised by stakeholder(s)

- IITB Governance
- BOSS
- Interoperability

#### 2.7.3. What is being done about this concern

Analysis to be completed. Gaps to be highlighted and inform more actions in the 3. Coherent set of actions

### 2.8. Sustainability of skillsets

#### 2.8.1. Summary

If DevOps teams are responsible to maintain their IT Products in production, have the authority to choose their technical stacks, and expected to have cross-functional skillsets (e.g., UX, Security, and enough technical expertise to maintain their solutions in production), how do we mitigate the turn over risk that such expertise leaves a team?

#### 2.8.2. Raised by stakeholder(s)

- BOSS

#### 2.8.3. What is being done about this concern

TBD

### 2.9. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solutions

#### 2.9.1. Summary

How are ERPs like SAP and PeopleSoft fit in this Target Model? Especially that Lines of Businesses are currently developing and testing the IT Solutions for ERP while the Strategy calls for DevOps teams to do those functions.

#### 2.9.2. Raised by stakeholder(s)

- BOSS

#### 2.9.3. What is being done about this concern

TBD

### 2.10. Clarity on the definition of “IT Product”

#### 2.10.1. Summary

Need to be clear on what we mean by “IT Product”. e.g., does MS Office constitute an IT Product? If taking the direction of the APM Program, an “IT Product” would not be a COTS, but rather a solution that can make use of one a more COTS.

#### 2.10.2. Raised by stakeholder(s)

- BSIM

#### 2.10.3. What is being done about this concern

Adding an action in 3. Coherent set of actions, to provide a standard meaning within IITB on what we mean by an “IT Product”.

### 2.11. Risk to project management overhead

#### 2.11.1. Summary

The strategy looks at limiting the size of projects to Small and below. Is it expected that, should an initiative require multiple releases to production and passes the $2.5M threshold, to redo the Project Management Lifecycle for the subsequent releases?

If so, this creates a risk of too much overhead for IT Teams to handle and may result in slowing delivery.

#### 2.11.2. Raised by stakeholder(s)

- BSIM

#### 2.11.3. What is being done about this concern

TBD.

Explore multi-gated (3 and 4) PMLC approach.

### 2.12. Risk to capability-based planning ability

#### 2.12.1. Summary

There is a risk that smaller investments promote continuing investing in the wrong IT Product and, as such, limit the organization’s ability to improve a given capability.

A potential scenario is that what was thought of spending $500k to a legacy product one time, comes up as a series of small investments over the year aggregated to more than $2.5M. In hindsight, the organization may have preferred to use that $2.5M towards transitioning to a modern IT Product instead.

#### 2.12.2. Raised by stakeholder(s)

- EA

#### 2.12.3. What is being done about this concern

TBD. The current thinking is to improve the organization’s monitoring ability by linking investments to the health of capabilities, capturing when such investment reaches a threshold to change course and have resources shifting somewhere else.

## Appendix A - Archived

This appendix lists the concerns that have been addressed and removed from this document

Concern |Description of what was done to address
---------|----------
 Bi-Modal management overhead | The original strategy’s language called for a bi-modal approach: using two different models in parallel to compare their performance before moving to a single one.<br><br>The strategy’s language has been changed to define a Target Model and offer a path towards the Target Model. There is no intent in managing to modes of operation, only that there will be a transition period towards the Target State.
 Stage of the PMLC to choose this alternate model and under whose authority | This area of concern regarded the original scope of the strategy: being an alternate model in parallel of the conventional one (i.e., see bi-modal above).<br><br>The strategy has since then been modified to be the Target State. There is no option and, instead, we need to move towards this model.<br><br>As such, this concern no longer applies.
