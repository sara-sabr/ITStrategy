## Adding some SaaS to technology bricks

### Purpose

To seek approval and endorsement for IITB to enable open access to specific Software as a Service (SaaS) tools available on the Internet for IITB employees, as well as other groups of ESDC employees (e.g.: management).

### Background

The upcoming Policy on Service and Digital replaces the Policy on Acceptable Network and Device Use (PANDU) but keeps the intent to "provide open access to Internet tools and services to support public servants in their work duties, enhance collaboration and networking with their peers".
This Policy applies only to unclassified assets (data, information, code, ..).

### Issue

To be able to follow the Policy, ESDC would need better Data Loss Prevention (DLP), including a tool that would monitor and enforce classification of files before they can be transmitted on the Internet.

Enterprise Architecture (EA) has started to include some SaaS in the ESDC Technology Bricks (GitHub, Trello and Slack), but these don't reflect what is actually available on ESDC network or what is currently being used by employees (See [Appendix B](#appendix-b---saas-already-unblocked)).

### Considerations

More departments are using SaaS to collaborate and engage with citizens or other public administrations in Canada and the world.
For example, the latest Open Government Plan and the Service and Digital Target Architecture from TBS were shared as drafts for consultation using Google Docs.
The GC Digital Academy and Free Agents, as well as other groups, frequently use Google Forms for registration.

### Recommendations

ESDC should invest in the required tools and resources to mitigate risks associated with more open access to the Internet SaaS tools.

IITB should enable additional SaaS tools (See [Appendix A](#appendix-a---saas-to-unblock)) for IITB employees as a first step toward providing more open access to Internet tools for more groups of ESDC employees.

### Next Steps

Should you approve, the IT Strategy team will work with teams in IITB to:

- Ensure the following SaaS (See [Appendix A](#appendix-a---saas-to-unblock)) are available and functional on the network for IITB employees
- Ensure proper understanding of document classification by IITB employees
- Find efficient ways to manage and monitor use of SaaS on the network
