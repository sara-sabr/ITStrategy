We are Information Technology (IT) strategy team under Strategy, Architecture and Business Relations Directorate (SABR), Innovation, Information and Technology Branch (IITB), Employment and Social Development  Canada (ESDC) Department.
Our team is passionate about working in the open and strongly believe the GC is better when work is visible and can be reused across groups, branches and departments.
We also strongly advocate for the use of open source software and DevOps.
Contributing to work in the open is framing our learning experience and exposing our work to not keeping it in a silo.
Working in the open is a culture and way of thinking.
To keep our work more visible we chose GitHub as opposed to typical internal records management system because GitHub is available on the Internet and makes use of the Git version control system.
We manage our work in an agile way in 2 week sprints using a kanban board and have standups, sprint planning sessions and regular retrospectives.

We are working on projects openly, blogging about what we are working on and what we are learning.
This is important because it helps us connect with other people who are working on similar challenges, builds trust and confidence in the work weâ€™re doing and generally makes things better.
Some of our team members are actively sharing their thoughts and getting feedback and comments from a big audience on Twitter.

Finally, through many team-building activities we have built a sense of trust among teammates that allows us to bring the full power of our skills, personalities, and who we are at work.
