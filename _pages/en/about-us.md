We are Information Technology (IT) strategy team under Strategy, Architecture and Business Relations Directorate (SABR), Innovation, Information and Technology Branch (IITB), Employment and Social Development  Canada (ESDC) Department.
Our team is passionate about working in the open and strongly believe the GC is better when work is visible and can be reused across groups, branches and departments.
We also strongly advocate for the use of open source software and DevOps.

We work in the open using GitHub and this website so that we can connect with the digital community within the GC and beyond.
We share by blogging about the initiatives and strategies we are working on and what we are learning along the way.

This is important because it helps us connect with other people who are working on similar challenges, builds trust and confidence in the work weâ€™re doing and generally makes things better.

Working in the open is part of our culture, frames our way of thinking and is aligned with the GC Digital Standards.
We manage our work in an agile way with month long sprints using a kanban board and have standups, sprint planning sessions and regular retrospectives.

Finally, through many team-building activities we have built a sense of trust among teammates that allows us to bring the full power of our skills, personalities, and who we are at work.
