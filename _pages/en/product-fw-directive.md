    <p align="center"><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong></p>
    <p>
This document <strong>does NOT</strong> attempt to explain all aspects of Product Management (such as vision setting, user research, and the different phases a product goes through in its life cycle).
These are well documented already, such as on <a href="https://www.pmi.org/disciplined-agile/process/product-management">PMI.org</a> and <a href="https://community.pdma.org/knowledgehub/home">PDMA.org</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Instead, this documents seeks to provide structure to ESDC Programs and IITB in the <strong>transition</strong> from project to product, <strong>within a Canadian federal government context</strong>.
    In particular, the methods to <strong>fund cross-functional and cross-branch product teams</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Directive and Standard strive to be as succinct and to the point as possible, without repeating rules in existing policy instruments that teams are expected to comply with (such as Financial and Security). To help the reader understand the rationale behind them and provide guidance in implementing them, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/product-fw-guidance.html">a Guidance document has been written</a>.

10. The agreement between IITB and the Sponsoring Branch is formalized in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) as per the [IITB Standard on Product Management](product-fw-standard.html#memorandum-of-understanding-mou)

    - One or more Product Manager, as per the [IITB Standard on Product Management](product-fw-standard.html#product-manager-role)

5. The yearly product roadmap is endorsed by IITB's Project Portfolio Review Committee (PPRC) as part of the Product Team's yearly funding cycle

## Consequences of Non-Compliance

The approach for non-compliance will be one where the severity of the consequences are gradually increased over time, at the judgement of both IITB and the Sponsoring Branch, as follows:

- Receiving a notification of non-compliance
- Requiring to explain reasons of non-compliance at a gradual level of committee engagement:
  - At the Project Portfolio Operations Committee (PPOC) for first time explanation
  - At the Project Portfolio Review Committee (PPRC) for a second time explanation
  - At Corporate Management Committee (CMC) for a third time explanation
- Requiring the product team members to go on product management and Agile training, at the sponsoring Branch's costs
- Requiring to have the Product's Roadmap endorsed by the Architecture Review Committee (ARC) as part of the product team's yearly funding renewal
- Requiring to have the Product's Roadmap endorsed by PPRC as part of the product team's yearly funding renewal
- Cancellation of the MOU between the Sponsoring Branch and the CIO in funding cross-branch product teams

PPOC produces a non-compliance report as per [IITB Standard on Product Management](product-fw-standard.html#non-compliance-report).

PPRC decides the consequences of a non-compliance.
