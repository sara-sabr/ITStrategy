## 1. Introduction

The Government of Canada (GC) aims to invigorate Canada's unique social market economy, promote competition and encourage SMEs — our innovators and entrepreneurs.
We want to bring Canada's people together in an inclusive, open approach, to find new opportunities and transition to an inclusive, better digital environment that is ready for the realities of today's global economy.

In all of this, open standards and open source software (OSS) have a role to play.

OSS is present everywhere.
All around the world, companies and public services are using open collaborative methods to innovate and build new solutions.
It powers the cloud and provides professional tools for big data and for information and knowledge management.
It is in supercomputers, blockchain, the internet of things and artificial intelligence.
It is in the internet.
It is in our phones and our TVs.
It provides us with streaming media.
It is in our cars.
The chances are that, in any new project involving software, from kitchen appliances, through web-based public services to highly specialised industrial tools, most of the code will be based on OSS.

Open standards are a set of rules designed to do a specific job in technology.
Open standards refer to file formats, protocols and application interfaces that can be implemented by everyone (in OSS and proprietary software alike) since the specifications are available at no cost, and since their development and standardization is open and transparent.

Open standards and OSS are close to the essence of public service, because:

- it is public code, which makes it a good use of public money, one that promotes freedom of choice and avoids getting "locked in";
- it makes it easy to use and reuse solutions, so we can pool efforts to create valuable cross-department services that are interoperable, and increase efficiency; and
- it is easy and efficient to add features to OSS, which can be freely shared with anyone, for any purpose. This means that everyone can benefit.

The process for the development of open standards, similar to OSS, is open and transparent to all interested parties.
It cannot be controlled by any single person or entity with any vested interests, because:

- open standards are platform independent, vendor neutral and usable for multiple implementations;
- specifications and supporting material are freely available with limited restrictions; and
- they are supported by the community and demonstrate independence or approved through due process by rough consensus among participants.

Working across the ESDC, and joined by other GC departments, provicial Governments, companies and the public at large, we can build new, innovative digital solutions that support our common policies and activities, and work towards technological sovereignty.

Open standards and OSS allows for incremental innovation, based on the sharing of knowledge and skills.
Openness increases trust in public services.
It helps to solve complex technological problems by getting others to contribute unexpected solutions.

Being free to inspect and improve, OSS offers more options for increasing security.
It allows for independent audits and code inspections, so the time and effort spent can be balanced according to need.
This improves security, not just for us, but for everyone.

This "Open First" strategy reinforces the ESDC's internal working culture that is already largely based on the principles of working in the open, open standards ans OSS.
However, it will also help ESDC change some of its technological and information management processes.

To build Canada together, we have to get ready to contribute, and be ready to accept contributions from citizens.

The strategy is a practical instrument for achieving digital transformation in IITB, ESDC and the GC.
At the same time, in a world of increasing uncertainty, complexity and change, the co-creation of technology increases our capacity to act independently to safeguard our interests, uphold Canadian values and way of life, and help shape our future.

This strategy sets out how we encourage and leverage open principles and development practices to co-create, share and reuse across ESDC and the GC.
By removing legal barriers, we can make it easier to contribute to OSS projects and to share our own solutions.
The strategy brings ESDC closer to the OSS community, and makes us an agile contributor and an active participant.
It encourages us to explore opportunities for dedicated support services for open solutions that we consider critical.
We will make more and more use of open standards and OSS – in areas where it is practical, in the domain of IT, to areas where it makes sense and domains where it is strategic.

## 2. Vision

> ESDC leverages the transformative, innovative, and collaborative power of open standards and OSS, encouraging the sharing and reuse of solutions, knowledge and expertise, to deliver better Canadian services that enrich society and focus on lowering costs to that society.

The title of this strategy, "Open First", points to a change in mindset whereby the acquisition and development of software solutions takes account of openness, sharing and reuse, security, privacy, legal considerations and accessibility.
It also indicates a commitment actively to support developer communities.

## 3. Commitment

This chapter links this strategy to key GC and ESDC legislation, policies, directives, guidelines and more.

### Mandate Letters

Mandate letters outline the objectives that each minister will work to accomplish, as well as the pressing challenges they will address in their role.
The mandate letters for the [Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion](https://pm.gc.ca/en/mandate-letters/2019/12/13/minister-employment-workforce-development-and-disability-inclusion) and the [Minister of Families, Children and Social Development](https://pm.gc.ca/en/mandate-letters/2019/12/13/minister-families-children-and-social-development-mandate-letter) mention the following.

- Commitment to govern in a positive, open and collaborative way.
- Continue to raise the bar on openness, effectiveness and transparency in government.
- This means a government that is open by default.
- It means better digital capacity and services for Canadians.

### Digital Nations Charter

https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/improving-digital-services/digital9charter.html

- Promote interoperability of digital technologies, including by adopting a credible royalty free open standards policy.
- Strive to create future Government systems, tradecraft, manuals and standards as open source and shareable between Participants.
- Promote competition in digital markets, for all enterprises regardless of size, including in government procurement, encourage and support a dynamic start-up/scale-up culture in the digital and technology sectors, and promote sustainable economic growth through open markets.
- Be a member of the Open Government Partnership, promote digital technologies to facilitate transparency and citizen participation, and use open licences to produce and consume open data.

### Digital Standards

The [GC's Digital Standards](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html) form the foundation of the government's shift to becoming more agile, open, and user-focused.
They will guide teams in designing digital services in a way that best serves Canadians.

- Work in the open by default
- Use open standards and solutions
- Collaborate widely

### Digital Operations Strategic Plan: 2018-2022

https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-operations-strategic-plans/digital-operations-strategic-plan-2018-2022.html

- 2.1 Open government - Open data and Open by default
- 2.2 Collaborating with Canadians
- 4.4 IT Modernization - Introduce a strategy for use of OSS and open standards

### Policy on Service and Digital

The [Policy on Service and Digital](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32603) and supporting instruments serve as an integrated set of rules that articulate how Government of Canada organizations manage service delivery, information and data, information technology, and cyber security in the digital era.

#### Directive on Service and Digital

https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32601

##### Mandatory procedures for EA assessments

The [Mandatory procedures for EA assessments](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32602) are to be used by departmental architecture review boards and the GC enterprise architectural review board (EARB) as an assessment framework to review digital initiatives to ensure the GC acts as a single enterprise and to ensure departmental alignment with the GC digital direction.

- Data should only be purchased once and should align with international standards.
- Data should be shared openly by default as per the Directive on Open Government.
- Where possible, use open standards and OSS first.
- All source code must be released under an appropriate OSS license.
- Share code publicly when appropriate, and when not, share within the Government of Canada.

#### Directive on Open Government

https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=28108

- Maximizing the release of Government of Canada open data (structured data) and open information (unstructured documents and multi-media assets) under an open and unrestrictive licence.

### ESDC OSS Framework

The [ESDC OSS Framework (internal link)](https://dialogue/grp/CO7397744/MasterLib/ESDC%20Open%20Source%20Management%20Framework%20v%201.2.docx), endorsed ar ESDC EARB on March 16th 2020, provides guidance and sets direction around OSS product selection considerations and compliance obligations such as governance, code sharing, licensing and security to ESDC.
It is also to provide a list of recommendations, considerations and procedures for the adoption, management and promotion of OSS as the primary option for future and next iteration solutions of ESDC/IITB information systems.

- Define and focuse on the preferred areas of adoption, consider OSS in every aspect of the ICT Ecosystem+.
- Implement a process for the sharing and re-use of developed OSS efforts within the department, GoC and OSS Community.
- Establish an OSS Program Office with an OSS Management Compliance Officer to take on the responsibility and further define the process and reporting requirements to be able to recognize and address circumstances that arise from license auditing and compliance conditions.

## 4 Goals and Outcomes

These days, open standards and OSS is everywhere.
It has reshaped the landscape in the IT industry, is ubiquitous in manufacturing, and is an increasingly common instrument of public services.
Governments across Canada and in the worlds' leading nations have adopted policies on open standards and OSS.

Properly implemented, the strategy, its governing principles and its action plan will help us build and deliver better ICT solutions and services, to leverage the innovative and collaborative power of open standards, OSS and working in the open.
They will make ESDC and the GC part of the OSS community, an agile contributor and active participant.
By co-developing with other Canadian public-sector organisations and encouraging the sharing and reuse of our solutions, knowledge and expertise, we will deliver better services that enrich society and reduce its costs.

The strategy focuses on transformative and innovative aspects, and recognises open standards and OSS as catalysts for change.
In addition, it leverages initiatives in other GC departments/agencies and helps shape the conditions for OSS development and government innovation.
This chapter sets out the key reasons and principles underlying the new strategy.

### Progress towards digital autonomy

Change is a constant the department has to continuously take into account when acquiring and developing software based solutions to offer services to its citizens.

One high-level argument for an emphasis on open standards and OSS is made in the Prime Minister's mandate letter to the Minister of Digital Government:

> Encourage the use and development of OSS products and open data, allowing for experimentation within existing policy directives and building an inventory of validated and secure applications that can be used by government to share knowledge and expertise to support innovation.

Open standards and OSS impact the digital autonomy of Canada.
Against the hyper-scalers in the cloud, it is likely that open standards and OSS can give ESDC and the GC a chance to create and maintain its own, independent digital approach and stay in control of its processes, its information and its technology, because:

- open standards and OSS are independent of companies and countries. It minimises the risk of vendor lock-in and getting caught up in political shenanigans or trade disputes;
- open collaboration is the leading model and inherently provides the most flexible platform for software development at the digital frontier, from cloud, blockchain, high-performance computing and artificial intelligence to the internet of things;
- by leveraging open standards and OSS, ESDC can devise an approach to cloud computing and software-as-a-service (SaaS) that balances their advantages and risks;
- being open promotes trust in the GC and its institutions;
- with open standards and OSS, Canada invests in its own, independent and competitive position in these technology areas. It can focus on an open, decentralised information society that will also support Canadian actors and fiscal fairness; and
- open standards and OSS makes decentralised, federated services possible that can be independently audited. It allows ESDC to build solutions that are in harmony with its values: (CANADIAN ESDC VALUES) united in diversity, open and inclusive, non-discriminatory, and respectful of privacy.

Notes:

As such, it must integrate flexibility and course correction as part of its non-functional requirements.
It must become digitally autonomous in its decisions while leveraging all possible options devising its solutions.

### Implementing the Policy on Service and Digital

Crucially, this strategy helps the ESDC achieve the high-level objectives of the Policy on Service and Digital:

- Client service experience and government operations are improved through digital transformation approaches.
- Guided by a commitment to the guiding principles and best practices of the GC Digital Standards: design with users; iterate and improve frequently; work in the open by default; use open standards and solutions; address security and privacy risks; build in accessible from the start; empower staff to deliver better services; be good data stewards; design ethical services; collaborate widely.

The benefits of using open standards and OSS (the code or specification is public, free to reuse and collaboratively adapt and improve; it can be inspected for security issues, is independent from vendors, and gravitates towards interoperable systems) clearly underpin these objectives.

The Policy on Service and Digital makes it clear that working in the open and collaborative working methods will be the norm within the GC's IT community to foster the sharing of code, data and solutions.
The principal working methods encouraged by this strategy are open, inclusive and co-creative.

To drive efficiencies across the GC, the Policy on Service and Digital focuses on the client, ensuring proactive consideration at the design stage of key requirements of these functions in the development of operations and services.
It establishes an enterprise-wide, integrated approach to governance, planning and management.
Overall, the Policy on Service and Digital advances the delivery of services and the effectiveness of government operations through the strategic management of government information and data and leveraging of information technology, supporting the mandate of the Minister for Digital Government in leading the GC's digital transition.

The Directive on Service and Digital refers to cyber security of digital solutions and services.
OSS code can be inspected in detail and is easily included in systematic vulnerability scanning.
This is another practical link with the Policy and Directive on Service and Digital.

Notes:

Canada has established clear vision and designed it policies to nudge departments towards it.
By adopting this strategy, ESDC is taking another step in realizing the vision outlined by the government.

### Sharing and reuse benefits all

Open standards and OSS make it easy to share and reuse solutions, as well as data, information and knowledge.
This is also in line with the Policy on Service and Digital and the Mandatory Procedures for Enterprise Architecture (EA) Assessment:

- Data should be shared openly by default as per the Directive on Open Government
- All source code must be released under an appropriate OSS license
- Leverage and reuse existing solutions, components, and processes

Note:

Working in the open, including software development, helps ensure that the resources used in the development of solutions for Canadians are

This approach also enables further collaboration across the multiple jurisdictions within the country and with private sector as well.

### Contribute to the knowledge society

Sharing the GC's source code as information that others can learn from or reuse is our civic responsibility.
It lowers costs for society.
It increases knowledge.

The Directive on Open Government reflect the value of documents created by public organisations and encourage their reuse.
Like data and information, source code constitutes a vast, diverse and valuable pool of resources that can benefit the knowledge society.
Sharing will help maximise the growth potential of the digital economy, as communicated in the Digital Nation Charter's open market:

> Promote competition in digital markets, for all enterprises regardless of size, including in government procurement, encourage and support a dynamic start-up/scale-up culture in the digital and technology sectors, and promote sustainable economic growth through open markets.

This is why the strategy aims to make it possible for ESDC to share software using a process comparable to that for its documents.

Note:

Work done in the open supports greater transparency and accountability, ensuring that citizens can trust the public service in doing due diligence.

It helps contribute to the greater good by sharing knowledge and to ensure durability of investments done with our citizens money.

### Build a world class public service

Open standards and OSS are about co-creation and building public services that connect seamlessly across organisational silos and borders.
That is why it is a component in most of the actions in the ISA2 programme.
Building a responsible open Canada is something we can only do ourselves and the best way is to do it together.

A [Study on OSS governance at the European Commission](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/1aa67278-5464-11ea-aece-01aa75ed71a1) shows that their OSS strategy is in line with the best practices from public services and private companies.
It confirms that the strengthened policy on the use of OSS is the norm nearly everywhere.
The study's high-level recommendations are:

- emphasise the use and benefits of open source;
- create a dedicated open source entity that fosters and measures strategy adoption;
- improve procurement and product-management processes;
- establish an open culture;
- collaborate with communities and the OSS ecosystem;
- manage legal/licence/intellectual property rights issues; and
- enhance and develop the technical infrastructure and services.

This strategy is also in line with the [European Commission OSS strategy 2020-2023](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/en_ec_open_source_strategy_2020-2023.pdf) while building on the GC Policies, Directives and the Digital Standards.

The rest of the world has realized the value of working in the open by default.
Canada has a policy in line with the world's best approaches.

By adopting this strategy, ESDC is taking a stand and moves towards a world class public service.

## 5. Governing Principles

This strategy supports the Canada's aims of radical transformation by simplifying and streamlining processes.
It will help to make collaborative working methods the de-facto standard for the ESDC's work internally and with others.

It is important to stress that the principles and the action plan relate to existing work processes.
The use of OSS is commonplace across the GC and in many parts of ESDC there is an established OSS-like culture.
We simply need to do more and keep getting better at it.

The principles of this strategy will help us choose strategically between closely competing software solutions.
They keep our options open.
They will allow ESDC to choose non-open technologies where there are good reasons to do so, while encouraging us to plan for future open standards and OSS alternatives.
They give our developers the flexibility to gain expertise on the diversity of OSS platforms.
In return, this is how ESDC will learn about innovative new solutions.

The principles here are consistent with "state of the art" GC policies (see [Build a world class public service](#build-a-world-class-public-service).
They are aligned with the [Mandatory Procedures for EA Assessment](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32602) and the [Digital Standards](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html), in particular "maximize reuse", "work in the open by default" and "use open standards and OSS first".
They also uphold the principles of the [ESDC OSS Framework](https://dialogue/grp/CO7397744/MasterLib/ESDC%20Open%20Source%20Management%20Framework%20v%201.2.docx), concentrating on making them actionable.

Below are the six principles that govern this strategy:

### Open First

> Use open standards and OSS first.
> Work in the open by default.

The GC is an enthusiastic user of and contributor to OSS.
This is reflected in its Digital Standards and Policy on Service and Digital, which encourages the IT community to tap into the growing potential of open standards and OSS as well as join forces with major commercial players and communities, and mobilise co-creation capacity to support departments in pioneering new solutions.

The GC [Guide for using OSS](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/open-source-software/guide-for-using-open-source-software.html) provides recomendations how to: actively and fairly consider Open Source Software; verify OSS ownership or licence; evaluate support options; use OSS with or without modification.

### Transform

> We harness the working principles of OSS;
> we innovate and co-create, share and reuse, and together build user-centric, data-driven public services.

We adopt a working culture based on the principles of open, sharing and reuse.
We nudge ESDC and its working methods forward by highlighting the crucial role of open standards and OSS and related best practices for co-creation and collaboration.
Ideally, this transformation will go beyond IT, so that we apply open methods when working together and sharing information.

Open standards and OSS offer practical tools and methods for teams to work together and co-create solutions, to share their expertise freely in order to obtain better results and have their solutions in actual use sooner.
In these teams, which sometimes involve several directorates-general, developers look at software code written by their colleagues and try to insert new components.
They combine parts, borrow tools and recipes, and together build and extend a collection of solutions they can use to run digital government solutions.

Inner source (the creation of working cultures based on open principles and share code within the organization) will be promoted, in order to bring teams closer to working in the open and encourage sharing and reuse within the organisation.
This is a step towards opening up more projects as open source code and sharing them with the outside world.

### Share

> All source code must be released under an appropriate OSS license.
> We enable incidental contributions to related open standards and OSS projects.

Wherever it makes sense to do so, the ESDC will share the source code of its future IT projects.
For publication of these projects, the OSS licences recommended by GC (MIT, Apache2, GPL3, AGPL3 or LGPL3) will be preferred.
ESDC will focus these efforts on an ESDC-centric digital government code repository.
In addition, our developers will be free to make occasional contributions to closely related open standards and OSS projects.

The principles and actions of this strategy will make it easier to obtain permission to share code with the outside world.

Currently, the paperwork involved in this process takes time to complete and this holds back many of our in-house projects.
This situation needs to change.

The GC [Guide for publishing open source code](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/open-source-software/guide-for-publishing-open-source-code.html) provides recomendations how to: seek approvals, obtain rights to custom code in contracts; consider security implications; select OSS licence; select source code repository; add recommended files; publishing a legacy application.

### Contribute

> We strive to be an active member of the diverse open standards and OSS ecosystem.

To be an active member of the diverse open standards and OSS ecosystem, we will continue to gain expertise to address product management and governance.
ESDC will seek to become an active contributing member of key communities where it can add value, and while balancing costs.

On the basis of the principles set out here, we will build and maintain lasting, meaningful relationships with open standards and OSS communities, building on experience from CEF, the EU-free and OSS auditing (EU-FOSSA/EU-FOSSA2) project and the ISA2 programme.
This will contribute to the viability of the ecosystem and facilitate product management and governance.

In addition to sharing source code, ESDC should consider joining open-source programme boards and committees, devise systematic methods for targeted funding, work to improve security and find ways to help critical open-source projects become self-sustainable.

The GC [Guide for Contributing to OSS](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/open-source-software/guide-for-contributing-to-open-source-software.html) provides recomendations how to: verify OSS licence; verify contributing process and policies; additional approvals; contribute to the project; contribute through professional services; publish contributions regardless of upstream acceptance.

### Secure

> We make sure the code we use and the code we share is free from vulnerabilities by applying continuous security testing.

Following IT security best practices and monitoring security advisories, automated continuous security testing will be in place to make sure that OSS components that we use in our applications are free from vulnerabilities.
Likewise, we will thoroughly test the code that we intend to share.

ESDC already has experience in this area in our security teams and the Computer Emergency Response Team for the institutions (CERT-EU), and from EU-FOSSA/EU-FOSSA2.

Notes:

Security and privacy methods and tools should be made available for all to ensure that this practice can be accomplished with the least barriers as possible.

### Stay in control

> We promote open standards and specifications that are implemented and distributed in OSS as a way to avoid vendor lock-in.

Interoperability is of utmost importance to the ESDC and the GC.
The key to interoperability is the use of well-established standards and specifications.
To ensure our digital sovereignty and guarantee a level playing-field, for all future IT developments ESDC will promote standards and specifications that are implemented and distributed through OSS, and include this in its corporate governance approach.

## 6. Implementing the Strategy

The GC is an enthusiastic user of and contributor to free and OSS.
This "Open First" strategy will ensure that ESDC becomes even more involved.

### Current situation and lessons learned

TODO: OSS Framework has identified current state as (see Framework for more details) Mainly OSS is in use already but before Framework wasn't clear on how to maintain best practices. Framework approved but not implemented.

### The right balance

This strategy comes with an action plan that details how ESDC will encourage and leverage open standards and OSS development practices to co-create, share and reuse across the organisation.
In addition to this internal focus on an open working culture, the strategy and action plan provide for increasing outreach to open standards and OSS communities and will help ESDC become a strong force in the community of Canadian public services actively involved in open standards and OSS.

With these internal and external activities, the strategy and action plan constitute practical instruments to help achieve the digital transformation of ESDC.

### Open First Center of Enablement (CoE)

This strategy is firmly rooted in the ESDC's and the wider GC policy context.
For it to succeed, a proper enabling environment must be put in place to guide, encourage and nudge change across the organisation.

The strategy and the action plan are inextricably linked.
The pivotal point will be an Open First CoE that enjoys genuine political and organisational support, involving all directorates-general.
The CoE will act as facilitator for all activities outlined in the strategy and the action plan.
It will assist subject-matter experts, encourage the directorates-general and help balance internal focus and external activities.

As domain leader for IT, IITB will be responsible for setting up and running the Programme Office.
This will allow it to set priorities, measure outcomes and report on progress.

IITB will make an annual budget request for the CoE and the action plan, to be reviewed and approved through the normal budgetary procedures.
Using the existing corporate IT governance structures, IITB will report on, monitor and review the action plan, and deliver a mid-term review of progress and implementation of the strategy.

### Actions and impact

The best way to lead is by example.
This strategy will rapidly produce tangible evidence of the benefits of a working culture based on open principles.
In addition, by simplifying the rules on sharing ESDC software and contributing to OSS projects, it will prove the value of open standards and OSS to the organisation and to society at large.

| Actions | Impact |
|---|---|
| Set up Open First CoE | Expedite all activities in the action plan |
| Set and promote the inner source default | Enable co-creation and collaboration |
| Enhance the software repository | Enable co-creation and collaboration |
| Revise software distribution practices | Process simplification; lower cost to society |
| Enable and create innovation with open standards and OSS labs | Drive innovation; encourage co-creation |
| Develop skills and recruit expertise | Contribute to staff recruitment and retention |
| Increase outreach to communities | Encourage innovation; improve services |
| Integrate open standards and OSS in internal IT governance | Increase organisational efficiency; foster innovation |
| Ensure security | Increase value of open standards and OSS to the organisation and society |
| Encourage and promote inner source | Instrumental to success of strategy and actions |

These actions will provide the tools to reinforce and extend the open-source working culture.
Our source code will gradually become available to all developer teams in ESDC and the Government of Canada.
Once the legal barriers are removed, we will make an increasing number of our solutions publicly available.
We will then also be able to contribute to the tools on which we depend.
This will help prepare us to accept contributions to our own work from outside the organisation.

We will make sure that the OSS reused by ESDC is free from security vulnerabilities.
Similarly, we will include in our security testing all of the code that we make available as OSS.
The open-source working methods and tools will be available to interested colleagues and we will help them try out innovative open-source solutions.
We can focus on recruiting staff with proven open-source expertise and strengthen ties with open-source communities, by organising joint activities and finding practical ways to help projects achieve sustainability.

When selecting new IT solutions, we will put more emphasis on the role of open standards and OSS.
By balancing immediate technological needs and future flexibility, we can take account of sovereignty, openness and long-term interests.

To make sure these actions are executed in an organised, coordinated and scheduled manner, the strategy establishes a small CoE.
It will liaise between projects, teams and subject-matter experts, and encourage the organisation on its path towards an open working culture.
