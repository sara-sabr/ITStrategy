## 1. Introduction

The Government of Canada (GC) aims to invigorate Canada's unique social market economy, promote competition and encourage SMEs — our innovators and entrepreneurs.
We want to bring Canada's people together in an inclusive, open approach, to find new opportunities and transition to an inclusive, better digital environment that is ready for the realities of today's global economy.

In all of this, open standards and open source software (OSS) have a role to play.

OSS is present everywhere.
All around the world, companies and public services are using open collaborative methods to innovate and build new solutions.
It powers the cloud and provides professional tools for big data and for information and knowledge management.
It is in supercomputers, blockchain, the internet of things and artificial intelligence.
It is in the internet.
It is in our phones and our TVs.
It provides us with streaming media.
It is in our cars.
It runs Europe's air traffic control.
The chances are that, in any new project involving software, from kitchen appliances, through web-based public services to highly specialised industrial tools, most of the code will be based on OSS.

Open standards are a set of rules designed to do a specific job in technology.
Open standards refer to file formats, protocols and application interfaces that can be implemented by everyone (in OSS and proprietary software alike) since the specifications are available at no cost, and since their development and standardization is open and transparent.

Open standards and OSS are close to the essence of public service, because:

- it is public code, which makes it a good use of public money, one that promotes freedom of choice and avoids getting "locked in";
- it makes it easy to use and reuse solutions, so we can pool efforts to create valuable cross-department services that are interoperable, and increase efficiency; and
- it is easy and efficient to add features to OSS, which can be freely shared with anyone, for any purpose. This means that everyone can benefit.

- process for the open standard development is open and transparent to all interested parties and cannot be controlled by any single person or entity with any vested interests;
- open standards are platform independent, vendor neutral and usable for multiple implementations;
- specifications and supporting material are freely available with limited restrictions;
- supported by the community and demonstrate independence or approved through due process by rough consensus among participants.

Working across the organisation (ESDC), and joined by other GC departments/agencies, companies and the public at large, we can build new, innovative digital solutions that support our common policies and activities, and work towards technological sovereignty.

Open standards and OSS allows for incremental innovation, based on the sharing of knowledge and skills.
Openness increases trust in public services.
It helps to solve complex technological problems by getting others to contribute unexpected solutions.

Being free to inspect and improve, OSS offers more options for increasing security. It allows for independent audits and code inspections, so the time and effort spent can be balanced according to need.
This improves security, not just for us, but for everyone.

This Open First strategy reinforces the ESDC's internal working culture that is already largely based on the principles of OSS.
However, it will also help ESDC change some of its technological and information management processes.

To build Canada together, we have to get ready to contribute, and be ready to accept contributions from citizens.

The strategy is a practical instrument for achieving digital transformation in IITB, ESDC and the GC.
At the same time, in a world of increasing uncertainty, complexity and change, the co-creation of technology increases our capacity to act independently to safeguard our interests, uphold Canadian values and way of life, and help shape our future.

This strategy sets out how we encourage and leverage open first principles and software development practices to co-create, share and reuse across the organisation.
By removing legal barriers, we can make it easier to contribute to OSS projects and to share our own solutions.
The strategy brings ESDC closer to the OSS community, and makes us an agile contributor and an active participant.
It encourages us to explore opportunities for dedicated support services for open source solutions that we consider critical.
We will make more and more use of open standards and OSS – in areas where it is practical, in the domain of IT, to areas where it makes sense and domains where it is strategic.

## 2. Vision

> ESDC leverages the transformative, innovative, and collaborative power of open standards and OSS, encouraging the sharing and reuse of solutions, knowledge and expertise, to deliver better Canadian services that enrich society and focus on lowering costs to that society.

The title of this strategy, ‘Open First', points to a change in mindset whereby the development of software solutions takes account of openness, sharing and reuse, security, privacy, legal considerations and accessibility.
It also indicates a commitment actively to support OSS developer communities

## 3. Commitment

This chapter links the Open First strategy to key GC legislation, policies and plans.

### Directive on Open Government

> Maximizing the release of Government of Canada open data (structured data) and open information (unstructured documents and multi-media assets) under an open and unrestrictive licence.

### Digital Standards

- Work in the open by default
- Use open standards and solutions
- Collaborate widely

### Digital Operation Strategic Plan

### Policy on Service and Digital

#### Directive on Service and Digital

##### Mandatory procedures for EA assessments

- Data should only be purchased once and should align with international standards.
- Data should be shared openly by default as per the Directive on Open Government.
- Encourage data sharing and collaboration.
- Where possible, use open standards and OSS first.
- All source code must be released under an appropriate OSS license.
- Share code publicly when appropriate, and when not, share within the Government of Canada.

### ESDC and GC Mandate letters

## 4 Goals and Outcomes

These days, OSS is everywhere.
It has reshaped the landscape in the IT industry, is ubiquitous in manufacturing, and is an increasingly common instrument of public services.
Governments across Canada and in the worlds' leading nations have adopted policies on open standards and OSS.

Properly implemented, the strategy, its governing principles and its action plan will help us build and deliver better ICT solutions and services, to leverage the innovative and collaborative power of being open.
They will make ESDC and the GC part of the OSS community, an agile contributor and active participant.
By co-developing with other Canadian public-sector organisations and encouraging the sharing and reuse of our solutions, knowledge and expertise, we will deliver better services that enrich society and reduce its costs.

The strategy focuses on transformative and innovative aspects, and recognises open standards and OSS as catalysts for change.
In addition, it leverages initiatives in other GC departments/agencies and helps shape the conditions for OSS development and government innovation.
This chapter sets out the key reasons and principles underlying the new strategy.

### Progress towards digital autonomy

### Implementing the Policy on Service and Digital

### Sharing and reuse benefits all

### Contribute to the knowledge society

### Build a world class public service

## 5. Governing Principles

The Open First strategy supports the Canada's aims of radical transformation by simplifying and streamlining processes.
It will help to make collaborative working methods the de-facto standard for the Commission's work internally and with others.

It is important to stress that the principles and the action plan relate to existing work processes.
The use of OSS is commonplace across the GC and in many parts of the organisation (ESDC) there is an established OSS-like culture.
We simply need to do more and keep getting better at it.

Below are the six principles that govern the strategy:

### Open First

### Transform

### Share

### Contribute

### Secure

### Stay in control

## 6. Implementing the Strategy

### Current situation and lessons learned

### The right balance

### Open First Center of Enablement (CoE)

This strategy is firmly rooted in the ESDC's and the wider GC policy context.
For it to succeed, a proper enabling environment must be put in place to guide, encourage and nudge change across the organisation.

The strategy and the action plan are inextricably linked.
The pivotal point will be an Open First CoE that enjoys genuine political and organisational support, involving all directorates-general.
The CoE will act as facilitator for all activities outlined in the strategy and the action plan.
It will assist subject-matter experts, encourage the directorates-general and help balance internal focus and external activities.

As domain leader for IT, IITB will be responsible for setting up and running the Programme Office.
This will allow it to set priorities, measure outcomes and report on progress.

IITB will make an annual budget request for the CoE and the action plan, to be reviewed and approved through the normal budgetary procedures.
Using the existing corporate IT governance structures, IITB will report on, monitor and review the action plan, and deliver a mid-term review of progress and implementation of the strategy.

### Actions and impact

The best way to lead is by example.
This strategy will rapidly produce tangible evidence of the benefits of a working culture based on open principles.
In addition, by simplifying the rules on sharing ESDC software and contributing to OSS projects, it will prove the value of open standards and OSS to the organisation and to society at large.

| Actions | Impact |
|---|---|
| Set up Open Source Programme Office | Expedite all activities in the action plan |
| Set and promote the inner source default | Enable co-creation and collaboration |
| Enhance the software repository | Enable co-creation and collaboration |
| Revise software distribution practices | Process simplification; lower cost to society |
| Enable and create innovation with open-source labs | Drive innovation; encourage co-creation |
| Develop skills and recruit expertise | Contribute to staff recruitment and retention |
| Increase outreach to communities | Encourage innovation; improve services |
| Integrate open source in internal IT governance | Increase organisational efficiency; foster innovation |
| Ensure security | Increase value of open source to the organisation and society |
| Encourage and promote inner source | Instrumental to success of strategy and actions |

These actions will provide the tools to reinforce and extend the open-source working culture.
Our source code will gradually become available to all developer teams in the Commission.
Once the legal barriers are removed, we will make an increasing number of our solutions publicly available.
We will then also be able to contribute to the tools on which we depend.
This will help prepare us to accept contributions to our own work from outside the organisation.

We will make sure that the OSS reused by ESDC is free from security vulnerabilities.
Similarly, we will include in our security testing all of the code that we make available as OSS.
The open-source working methods and tools will be available to interested colleagues and we will help them try out innovative open-source solutions.
We can focus on recruiting staff with proven open-source expertise and strengthen ties with open-source communities, by organising joint activities and finding practical ways to help projects achieve sustainability.

When selecting new IT solutions, we will put more emphasis on the role of open standards and OSS.
By balancing immediate technological needs and future flexibility, we can take account of sovereignty, openness and long-term interests.

To make sure these actions are executed in an organised, coordinated and scheduled manner, the strategy establishes a CoE.
It will liaise between projects, teams and subject-matter experts, and encourage the organisation on its path towards an open working culture.
