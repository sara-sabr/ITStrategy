## 1. Introduction

The [mission (raison d'être)](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/reports/departmental-plan/2018/mandate-role.html) of Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) is to build a stronger and more inclusive Canada, to support Canadians in helping them live productive and rewarding lives and improving Canadians' quality of life.

The Government of Canada (GC) aims to invigorate Canada's unique social market economy, promote competition and encourage SMEs — our innovators and entrepreneurs.
We want to build stronger ties with Canadians by being more transparent and by building solution together.

In all of this, open standards and open source software (OSS) have a role to play.

### What are open standards and OSS

Open standards are a set of rules designed to do a specific job in technology.
They refer to file formats, protocols and application interfaces that can be implemented by everyone (in open source and proprietary software alike).

Inspired by France's [Référentiel Général d'Interopérabilité](https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/publications/interoperabilite/) or "General Guidelines for Interoperability", the Quebec government's [Cadre Commun d'Interopérabilité](https://www.tresor.gouv.qc.ca/ressources-informationnelles/architecture-dentreprise-gouvernementale/standards-et-normes/cadre-commun-dinteroperabilite/) or the "Common interoperability framework", the [European Interoperability Framework](https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/eif_en) and the British Cabinet Office's [Open Standards Principles](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-principles/open-standards-principles), the following criteria define open standards:

- process for the standard's development is open and transparent to all interested parties and cannot be controlled by any single person or entity with any vested interests;
- platform independent, vendor neutral and usable for multiple implementations;
- specifications and supporting material are freely available with limited restrictions;
- supported by the community and demonstrate independence or approved through due process by rough consensus among participants.

Free software is software that respects users' freedom and community.
It is defined by four essential freedoms: to run the program, study how it works, modify it and redistribute it.
Access to the source code is a precondition for these freedoms and not the end goal itself.

OSS is software where the source code is distributed and can be used, copied, studied and redistributed.
Free software and OSS are equivalent but represent two different visions.

All software licensed under an [Open Source Initiative approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) or a [Free Software Foundation free software licence](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#SoftwareLicenses) is considered OSS and can be used by the GC, based on the GC [Guide for using OSS](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/open-source-software/guide-for-using-open-source-software.html).

### Benefits of using open standards and OSS for ESDC and the GC

Open standards are the guidelines that enable international communities to speak a common language to build products in a structured fashion.
They are available at no cost since standardization is open and transparent.

Open standards and OSS are close to the essence of public service, because:

- it enables a cross-jurisdictional community to collaborate on solutions;
- it is public code, which makes it a good use of public money, one that promotes freedom of choice and avoids getting "locked in";
- it makes it easy to use and reuse solutions, so we can pool efforts to create valuable cross-department services that are interoperable, and increase efficiency; and
- it is easy and efficient to add features to OSS, which can be freely shared with anyone, for any purpose. This means that everyone can benefit.

The process for the development of open standards, similar to OSS, is open and transparent to all interested parties.
It cannot be controlled by any single person or entity with any vested interests, because:

- open standards are platform independent, vendor neutral and usable for multiple implementations;
- specifications and supporting material are freely available with limited restrictions; and
- they are supported by the community and demonstrate independence or approved through due process by rough consensus among participants.

More information, benefits and risks of open standards and OSS are available in the [Open First Whitepaper](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/open-source-software/open-first-whitepaper.html), written by the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat.
These benefits include:

- Flexibility - avoiding lock-in;
- Support for the local economy and communities;
- Cost savings; Security - reliance on hardening, not obfuscation;
- Productivity gains and collaboration;
- IT talent and job satisfaction; and
- Economic impact - increase use of Canadian resources.

### What this strategy seeks to accomplish

Working across ESDC, and joined by other GC departments, provincial Governments, companies and the public at large, we can build new, innovative digital solutions that support our common policies and activities, and work towards technology sovereignty.

Open standards and OSS allows for incremental innovation, based on the sharing of knowledge and skills.
Openness increases trust in public services.
It helps to solve complex technology problems by getting others to contribute unexpected solutions.

Being free to inspect and improve, OSS offers more options to increase the level of assurances that adequate security controls are applied.
It allows for independent audits and code inspections, so the time and effort spent can be balanced according to need.
This improves security, not just for us, but for everyone.

This "Open First" strategy reinforces the GC's Digital Standards, Policies and Directives that include working in the open, using open standards, using OSS, publishing open source code and contributing to OSS communities.
It will help ESDC change some of its technology and information management processes.

> **To build Canada together, we have to get ready to contribute, and be ready to accept contributions from citizens.**

This strategy is a practical instrument that supports and enables digital transformation in IITB and ESDC, and can be leveraged by others in the GC.

This strategy sets out how we encourage and leverage open principles and development practices to co-create, share and reuse across ESDC.
It brings ESDC closer to the OSS community, and makes us an agile contributor and an active participant.
It encourages us to explore opportunities for dedicated support services for open solutions that we consider critical.
We will make more and more use of open standards and OSS – in areas where it is practical, in the domain of IT, to areas where it makes sense and domains where it is strategic.

It was the Canadian Government's involvement in the fields of aviation, telephony, and nuclear technologies that spurred innovation and new industries in our country.
The Government is once again well positioned to rally the country into the growing IT field of open standards and OSS that employs tens of thousand of people across the country.
As a strong supporter of the GC's vision of open standards and OSS, ESDC can play a role in bringing this vision to fruition through the development and implementation of this strategy.

## 2. Vision

> ESDC leverages the transformative, innovative, and collaborative power of open standards and OSS, encouraging the sharing and reuse of solutions, knowledge and expertise, to deliver better Canadian services that enrich society and focus on lowering costs to that society.

The title of this strategy, "Open First", points to a change in mindset whereby the acquisition and development of software solutions takes account of openness, sharing and reuse, security, privacy, legal, accessibility, and achieving digital autonomy considerations.
It also indicates a commitment to actively support developer communities.

## 3. Commitments

This section links this strategy to key GC and ESDC legislation, policies, directives, guidelines and more.

### Mandate Letters

Mandate letters outline the objectives that each minister will work to accomplish, as well as the pressing challenges they will address in their role.

In the mandate letter for the [Minister of Digital Government](https://pm.gc.ca/en/mandate-letters/2019/12/13/minister-digital-government-mandate-letter) one of the top priorities is:

- Encourage the use and development of open source products and open data, allowing for experimentation within existing policy directives and building an inventory of validated and secure applications that can be used by government to share knowledge and expertise to support innovation.

The mandate letters for the [Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion](https://pm.gc.ca/en/mandate-letters/2019/12/13/minister-employment-workforce-development-and-disability-inclusion) and the [Minister of Families, Children and Social Development](https://pm.gc.ca/en/mandate-letters/2019/12/13/minister-families-children-and-social-development-mandate-letter) both mention the following:

- Commitment to govern in a positive, open and collaborative way.
- Continue to raise the bar on openness, effectiveness and transparency in government.
- This means a government that is open by default.
- It means better digital capacity and services for Canadians.

### Digital Nations Charter

The [Digital Nations](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-nations.html) is a collaborative forum of the world's leading digital governments that aims to use technology to improve citizens services in Canada and globally.
At the 2019 Digital Nations Ministerial Summit, they endorsed the [Digital Nations Charter](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/improving-digital-services/digital9charter.html) which outlines a mutual commitment to digital government service development and leadership.
It includes the following:

- Promote interoperability of digital technologies, including by adopting a credible royalty free open standards policy.
- Strive to create future Government systems, tradecraft, manuals and standards as open source and shareable between Participants.
- Promote competition in digital markets, for all enterprises regardless of size, including in government procurement, encourage and support a dynamic start-up/scale-up culture in the digital and technology sectors, and promote sustainable economic growth through open markets.
- Be a member of the Open Government Partnership, promote digital technologies to facilitate transparency and citizen participation, and use open licences to produce and consume open data.

### Digital Standards

The [GC's Digital Standards](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html) form the foundation of the government's shift to becoming more agile, open, and user-focused.
They guide teams in designing digital services in a way that best serves Canadians.
The Digital Standards include:

- Work in the open by default
- Use open standards and solutions
- Collaborate widely

### Policy on Service and Digital

The [Policy on Service and Digital](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32603) and supporting instruments serve as an integrated set of rules that articulate how GC organizations manage service delivery, information and data, information technology, and cyber security in the digital era.

- The CIO of Canada is responsible for establishing [guidance](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/open-source-software.html) to support innovative practices and technologies, including open-source and open-standard applications, and agile application development.
- Deputy heads are responsible for
  - Maximizing the release of departmental information and data as an open resource, discoverable through the GC open government portal.
  - Open access to digital tools - Providing authorized users of the departmental electronic network and of departmental devices with open access to the Internet, including GC and external Web 2.0 tools and services that enhance productivity, communication and open collaboration.

#### Directive on Service and Digital

The [Directive on Service and Digital](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32601) provides requirements for departments to align to the Policy on Service and Digital.

##### Mandatory procedures for EA assessments

The [Mandatory procedures for EA assessments](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32602) are to be used by departmental architecture review boards and the GC enterprise architectural review board (EARB) as an assessment framework to review digital initiatives to ensure the GC acts as a single enterprise and to ensure departmental alignment with the GC digital direction.

- Data should only be purchased once and should align with international standards.
- Data should be shared openly by default as per the Directive on Open Government.
- Where possible, use open standards and OSS first.
- All source code must be released under an appropriate OSS license.
- Share code publicly when appropriate, and when not, share within the Government of Canada.
- Design for cloud mobility and develop an exit strategy to avoid vendor lock-in.
- Model business processes using Business Process Management Notation (BPMN), an open standard, to identify common enterprise processes.

#### Directive on Open Government

The [Directive on Open Government](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=28108) promotes information management practices that enable the proactive and ongoing release of government information.

- Maximizing the release of Government of Canada open data (structured data) and open information (unstructured documents and multi-media assets) under an open and unrestrictive licence.

#### Directive on Automated Decision-Making

The objective of the [Directive on Automated Decision-Making](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32592) is to ensure that Automated Decision Systems are deployed in a manner that reduces risks to Canadians and federal institutions, and leads to more efficient, accurate, consistent, and interpretable decisions made pursuant to Canadian law.

- Releasing the final results of Algorithmic Impact Assessments in an accessible format via GC websites and any other services designated by the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat pursuant to the Directive on Open Government.

#### Standard on Metadata

The [Standard on Metadata](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18909) aims to increase the use of standardized metadata and value domains in support of the management of information resources.
Metadata requirements include open standards that should be used for record keeping, Web resource discovery and Web Content Management System (CMS):

- ISO 23081 - Records management processes - Metadata for records
- Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) Metadata Terms
- W3C Date and Time Formats
- ISO 8601 (Date and time Format)
- ISO 639-2 (Language codes)

#### Standard on Web Interoperability

The [Standard on Web Interoperability](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25875) improves Canadians’ web experience by using technologies that support mobile devices and by making information technology easier to use in order to find government information.
The following open standards are required to be used for all GC Web pages:

- Web feed requirements: Atom Syndication Format
- Character encoding requirements: UTF-8
- Mark-up language requirements: HTML5 or later
- HTML data requirements:
  - HTML data syntax: RDFa 1.1 Lite or later
  - Primary HTML data vocabulary: Schema.org

### Digital Operations Strategic Plan: 2018-2022

The [Digital Operations Strategic Plan 2018-2022](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-operations-strategic-plans/digital-operations-strategic-plan-2018-2022.html) is the third iteration in the GC's strategic planning process for how we manage technology and technological change in government.
It sets and provides insight into the government's digital direction.
Departments and agencies, chief information officers (CIOs) and officials should consider it as direction from the CIO of Canada.
Some strategic actions are:

- 2.1 Open government - Open data and Open by default
- 2.2 Collaborating with Canadians
- 4.4 IT Modernization - Introduce a strategy for use of OSS and open standards to set direction on the use and release of OSS and open standards that will be ratified using the GC EARB.

The Digital Standards and the Mandatory procedures for EA assessments, part of the Directive on Service and Digital introduced the strategy and direction for open standards and OSS in the GC.

### Open First Whitepaper

The [Open First Whitepaper](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/open-source-software/open-first-whitepaper.html) was written by the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) to unpack and get into the details on the subject of "Open" in order to inform a few initiatives, including the new GC Enterprise Architecture Review Board (EARB) in setting standards (open standards, open source software (OSS)) that would influence our technological ecosystem as well as our Information Management - Information Technology (IM-IT) practices.

The Whitepaper has sections on open standards, OSS use, OSS contribution, open markets and open culture.
Definitions, benefits and risks are explored for each section.

### OSS Guides

TBS also published Guides for [Using OSS](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/open-source-software/guide-for-using-open-source-software.html), [Publishing Open Source Code](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/open-source-software/guide-for-publishing-open-source-code.html) and [Contributing to OSS](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/open-source-software/guide-for-contributing-to-open-source-software.html) on the Canada.ca Website under digital government innovations.

### ESDC OSS Management Framework

The [ESDC OSS Management Framework (internal link)](https://dialogue/grp/CO7397744/MasterLib/ESDC%20Open%20Source%20Management%20Framework%20v%201.2.docx), endorsed at ESDC EARB on March 16th 2021, provides guidance and sets direction around OSS product selection considerations and compliance obligations such as governance, code sharing, licensing and security to ESDC.
It also provides a list of recommendations, considerations and procedures for the adoption, management and promotion of OSS as the primary option for future and next iteration solutions of ESDC/IITB information systems.
Some short term recommendations are:

- Define and focus on the preferred areas of adoption, consider OSS in every aspect of the IMIT ecosystem;
- Implement a process for the sharing and re-use of developed OSS efforts within the department, GoC and OSS Community; and
- Establish an OSS Program Office to take on the responsibility and further define the process and reporting requirements.

### ESDC Adopt, Buy and Build Strategy

The [Adopt, Buy and Build Strategy](https://sara-sabr.github.io/ITStrategy/strategy-build-vs-buy.html) provides IITB with an overarching strategy in the application of the GC Mandatory Procedures for EA Assessments and the Mandatory Procedures on APIs, in the context of acquiring new IT Solutions and assessing enhancements to existing IT Solutions.

- IT Solutions and IT Products comply with the ESDC OSS Management Framework when applicable.
- Increased ratio of OSS solutions and products used in production compared to purchased or internally developed ones that are not shareable and reusable.

### ESDC Target Solution Delivery Model

The [Target Solution Delivery Model](https://sara-sabr.github.io/ITStrategy/strategy-target-solution-delivery-model.html) provides ESDC with a path towards same day software delivery leading to DevOps practices and product management.

## 4 Goals and Outcomes

These days, open standards and OSS are everywhere.
It has reshaped the landscape in the IT industry, is ubiquitous in manufacturing, and is an increasingly common instrument of public services.
Governments across Canada (ex.:
[British-Colombia](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/government/services-for-government-and-broader-public-sector/information-technology-services/standards-files/1_02-v1_0-guidelines_on_the_use_of_open_source_software.pdf),
[Québec](https://www.tresor.gouv.qc.ca/fileadmin/PDF/ressources_informationnelles/logiciels_libres/ll.pdf),
[Montréal](http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/PRT_VDM_FR/MEDIA/DOCUMENTS/politique_materiel_libres_fr.pdf))
and around the worlds' leading nations (ex.:
[UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-principles/open-standards-principles),
[France](https://sill.etalab.gouv.fr/fr/software),
[Italy](https://docs.italia.it/italia/developers-italia/gl-acquisition-and-reuse-software-for-pa-docs/en/stabile/index.html),
[USA](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf), ..)
have adopted policies, directives or guidance on open standards and OSS.

Properly implemented, this strategy, its governing principles and its action plan will help us build and deliver better IT solutions and services, to leverage the innovative and collaborative power of open standards, OSS and working in the open.
They will make ESDC and the GC part of the OSS community, an agile contributor and active participant.
By co-developing with other Canadian public-sector organisations and encouraging the sharing and reuse of our solutions, knowledge and expertise, we will deliver better services that enrich society and reduce its costs.

This strategy focuses on transformative and innovative aspects, and recognises open standards and OSS as catalysts for change.
In addition, it leverages initiatives in other GC departments/agencies and helps shape the conditions for OSS development and government innovation.
This section sets out the key reasons and principles underlying the new strategy.

### Progress towards digital autonomy

Change is a constant ESDC has to continuously take into account when acquiring and developing software based solutions to offer services internally and to citizens.

One high-level argument for an emphasis on open standards and OSS is made in the Prime Minister's mandate letter to the Minister of Digital Government:

> Encourage the use and development of OSS products and open data, allowing for experimentation within existing policy directives and building an inventory of validated and secure applications that can be used by government to share knowledge and expertise to support innovation.

Open standards and OSS impact the digital autonomy of Canada.
The mandatory procedures for EA assessments include: designing for cloud mobility and developing exit strategies to avoid vendor lock-in.
It is likely that open standards and OSS can give ESDC and the GC a chance to create and maintain its own, independent digital approach and stay in control of its processes, its information and its technology, because:

- open standards and OSS are independent of companies and countries. It minimises the risk of vendor lock-in and getting caught up in political shenanigans or trade disputes;
- open collaboration is the leading model and inherently provides the most flexible platform for software development at the digital frontier, from cloud, blockchain, high-performance computing and artificial intelligence to the internet of things;
- by leveraging open standards and OSS, ESDC can devise an approach to cloud computing and software-as-a-service (SaaS) that balances their advantages and risks;
- being open promotes trust in the ESDC and the GC;
- with open standards and OSS, ESDC invests in Canada's own, independent and competitive position in these technology areas. It can focus on an open, decentralised information society that will also support Canadian actors and fiscal fairness; and
- open standards and OSS makes decentralised, federated services possible that can be independently audited. It allows ESDC to build solutions that are in harmony with the commitment of the GC to govern in a positive, open and collaborative way as well as the [Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25049): Respect for Democracy, Respect for People, Integrity, Stewardship and Excellence.

### Implementing the Policy on Service and Digital

Crucially, this strategy helps ESDC achieve the high-level objectives of the Policy on Service and Digital:

- Client service experience and government operations are improved through digital transformation approaches.
- Guided by a commitment to the guiding principles and best practices of the GC Digital Standards: design with users; iterate and improve frequently; work in the open by default; use open standards and solutions; address security and privacy risks; build in accessible from the start; empower staff to deliver better services; be good data stewards; design ethical services; collaborate widely.

The benefits of using open standards and OSS (the code or specification is public, free to reuse and collaboratively adapt and improve; it can be inspected for security issues, is independent from vendors, and gravitates towards interoperable systems) clearly underpin these objectives.

The Policy on Service and Digital makes it clear that working in the open and collaborative working methods will be the norm within the GC's IT community to foster the sharing of code, data and solutions.
The principal working methods encouraged by this strategy are open, inclusive and co-creative.

To drive efficiencies across the GC, the Policy on Service and Digital focuses on the client, ensuring proactive consideration at the design stage of key requirements of these functions in the development of operations and services.
It establishes an enterprise-wide, integrated approach to governance, planning and management.
Overall, the Policy on Service and Digital advances the delivery of services and the effectiveness of government operations through the strategic management of government information and data and leveraging of information technology, supporting the mandate of the Minister for Digital Government in leading the GC's digital transition.

The Directive on Service and Digital refers to cyber security of digital solutions and services.
OSS code can be inspected in detail and is easily included in systematic vulnerability scanning.
This is another practical link with the Policy and Directive on Service and Digital.

With this strategy, ESDC is taking another step in realizing the vision outlined for the GC.

### Sharing and reuse benefits all

Open standards and OSS make it easy to share and reuse solutions, as well as data, information and knowledge.
This is also in line with the Policy on Service and Digital and the Mandatory Procedures for EA Assessment:

- Data should be shared openly by default as per the Directive on Open Government
- All source code must be released under an appropriate OSS license
- Leverage and reuse existing solutions, components, and processes
- Share code publicly when appropriate, and when not, share within the GC

More importantly, leveraging open standards and OSS enables ESDC to work in the open by default, including in software development and service design, creating incredible opportunities for cross-jurisdictional cooperation for the improvement of services to Canadians.

By adopting the OSS technologies and methodologies and ensuring that open standards and interoperability are mandatory to all its software enabled solutions, ESDC will be in a strategic position to share and leverage the knowledge of other departments and public services across the country.
Even citizens and companies would have the opportunity to study and contribute to these initiatives in a truly transparent way.

This is in line with industry best practices where companies have increasingly released open source code of software products, in parts or in whole, to realize economies of scale for software development and to focus on their core mandate.
Any ancillary capabilities are opened up and built in the open to create a place where many can collaborate on commonly needed software solutions.

Finally, this opens up new opportunities for smaller companies to get a foot in the door to do business with the GC since they wouldn't be written off de facto by the fact that only a few larger companies have acquired the rights to provide services related to proprietary software.
For example, [studies from the CNLL](https://cnll.fr/news/etude-pac-logiciel-libre-2015-2020/) (Conseil National du Logiciel Libre) show that the market share for OSS related services in France has grown from 2.5 billion euros in 2012 to 4.5 billion euros in 2017 and was expected to approach 6 billion euros in 2020.
This growth is in part due to the Policies of the French Government that favor the use of open standards and OSS.

This strategy could also result in promoting new commercial opportunities for Canadian open standards and OSS service providers with the GC and other business internationally.

### Contribute to the knowledge society

Sharing the GC's source code as information that others can learn from or reuse is our civic responsibility.
It lowers costs for society.
It increases knowledge.

The Directive on Open Government demonstrates the value of documents created by public organisations and encourage their reuse.
Like data and information, source code constitutes a vast, diverse and valuable pool of resources that can benefit the knowledge society.
Sharing will help maximise the growth potential of the digital economy, as communicated in the Digital Standards Guidance for "Work in the open by default":

> Working in the open increases the transparency of services, increases trust in government, creates an ecosystem that promotes innovation, prevents needing to reinvent the wheel by increasing collaboration within, and external to, government.

This is why this strategy aims to make it possible for ESDC to share open source code using a process comparable to the one for its open data and information.

### Build a world class public service

Open standards and OSS are about co-creation and building public services that connect seamlessly across organisational silos and borders.
That is why it is a component in most of the actions in the [ISA2](https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/isa2_en) programme.
Building a responsible open Canada is something we can only do ourselves and the best way is to do it together.

A [Study on OSS governance at the European Commission](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/1aa67278-5464-11ea-aece-01aa75ed71a1) shows that their OSS strategy is in line with the best practices from public services and private companies.
It confirms that the strengthened policy on the use of OSS is the norm nearly everywhere.
The study's high-level recommendations are:

- emphasise the use and benefits of open source;
- create a dedicated open source entity that fosters and measures strategy adoption;
- improve procurement and product-management processes;
- establish an open culture;
- collaborate with communities and the OSS ecosystem;
- manage legal/licence/intellectual property rights issues; and
- enhance and develop the technical infrastructure and services.

This strategy is in line with (and strongly influenced by) the [European Commission OSS strategy 2020-2023](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/en_ec_open_source_strategy_2020-2023.pdf) while building on GC Policies, Directives and the Digital Standards.

The rest of the world has realized the value of open standards, OSS and working in the open by default.
Canada has a Policy in line with the world's best approaches.

By adopting this strategy, ESDC is taking a stand and moving towards a world class public service.

## 5. Governing Principles

This strategy supports Canada's aims of radical transformation by simplifying and streamlining processes.
It will help to make collaborative working methods the de-facto standard for ESDC's work internally and with others.

It is important to stress that the principles and the action plan relate to existing work processes.
Open standards and OSS are already being used across the GC and in some parts of ESDC there is an established OSS-like culture.
We simply need to do more and continuously improve.

The principles of this strategy will help us choose strategically between closely competing software solutions.
They keep our options open.
They will allow ESDC to choose non-open technologies where there are good reasons to do so, while encouraging us to plan for future open standards and OSS alternatives.
They give our developers the flexibility to gain expertise on the diversity of OSS platforms.
In return, this is how ESDC will learn about innovative new solutions.

The principles here are consistent with "state of the art" GC policies (see [Build a world class public service](#build-a-world-class-public-service).
They are aligned with the [Mandatory Procedures for EA Assessment](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32602) and the [Digital Standards](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html), in particular "maximize reuse", "work in the open by default" and "use open standards and OSS first".
They also uphold the principles of the [ESDC OSS Framework](https://dialogue/grp/CO7397744/MasterLib/ESDC%20Open%20Source%20Management%20Framework%20v%201.2.docx), concentrating on making them actionable.

Below are the six principles that govern this strategy:

### Open First

> Use open standards and OSS first.
> Work in the open by default.

The GC is an enthusiastic user of and contributor to OSS.
This is reflected in its Digital Standards and Policy on Service and Digital, which encourages the IT community to tap into the growing potential of open standards and OSS as well as join forces with major commercial players and communities, and mobilise co-creation capacity to support departments in pioneering new solutions.

The GC [Guide for using OSS](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/open-source-software/guide-for-using-open-source-software.html) provides recommendations how to: actively and fairly consider Open Source Software; verify OSS ownership or licence; evaluate support options; use OSS with or without modification.

### Transform

> We harness the working principles of OSS;
> we innovate and co-create, share and reuse, and together build user-centric, data-driven public services.

We adopt a working culture based on the principles of open, sharing and reuse.
We nudge ESDC and its working methods forward by highlighting the crucial role of open standards and OSS and related best practices for co-creation and collaboration.
Ideally, this transformation will go beyond IT, so that we apply open methods when working together and sharing information.

Open standards and OSS offer practical tools and methods for teams to work together and co-create solutions, to share their expertise freely in order to obtain better results and have their solutions in actual use sooner.
In these teams, which sometimes involve several branches within ESDC, developers look at software code written by their colleagues and try to insert new components.
They combine parts, borrow tools and recipes, and together build and extend a collection of solutions they can use to run digital government solutions.

Inner source (the creation of working cultures based on open principles and share code within the organization) will be promoted, in order to bring teams closer to working in the open and encourage sharing and reuse within the organisation.
This is a step towards opening up more projects as open source code and sharing them with the outside world.

### Share

> All source code must be released under an appropriate OSS license.
> We enable incidental contributions to related open standards and OSS projects.

ESDC will strive to share the source code of its future IT projects by default.
In addition, our developers will be free to make occasional contributions to closely related open standards and OSS projects.

The principles and actions of this strategy will make it easier to obtain permission to share code with the outside world.

Currently, the paperwork involved in this process takes time to complete and this holds back many of our in-house projects.
This situation needs to change.

The GC [Guide for publishing open source code](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/open-source-software/guide-for-publishing-open-source-code.html) provides recommendations how to: seek approvals, obtain rights to custom code in contracts; consider security implications; select OSS licence; select source code repository; add recommended files; publishing a legacy application.

### Contribute

> We strive to be an active member of the diverse open standards and OSS ecosystem.

To be an active member of the diverse open standards and OSS ecosystem, we will continue to gain expertise to address product management and governance.
ESDC will seek to become an active contributing member of key communities where it can add value, and while balancing costs.

On the basis of the principles set out here, we will build and maintain lasting, meaningful relationships with open standards and OSS communities, building on experience from CEF, the EU-free and OSS auditing (EU-FOSSA/EU-FOSSA2) project and the [ISA2](https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/isa2_en) programme.
This will contribute to the viability of the ecosystem and facilitate product management and governance.

In addition to sharing source code, ESDC should consider joining open standards and OSS boards and committees, devise systematic methods for targeted funding, work to improve security and find ways to help critical open standards and OSS projects become self-sustainable.
This could enable ESDC to influence to direction of work which could also be leveraged by other government departments.
It could also provide opportunities to recruit talent.

The GC [Guide for Contributing to OSS](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/open-source-software/guide-for-contributing-to-open-source-software.html) provides recommendations how to: verify OSS licence; verify contributing process and policies; additional approvals; contribute to the project; contribute through professional services; publish contributions regardless of upstream acceptance.

### Secure

> We make sure the code we use and the code we share is free from vulnerabilities by applying continuous security testing.

Open standards and OSS rely on good security practices instead of obscurity.
A common misconception is that hiding code helps to prevent successful attacks.
As NIST standard body recommends: "System security should not depend on the secrecy of the implementation or its components".
Open standards and OSS development practices rely on hardening (or improving the security of) code by making it available for peers to test and try to break, and then fixing the problems found.

OSS projects like OpenSSL, OpenSSH or GnuPG are just some of the main technologies that underpin the security of the Internet today.
These projects are very widely used and supported in part by the [Linux Foundation Core Infrastructure Initiative](https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/).

Following IT security best practices and monitoring security advisories, automated continuous security testing will be in place to make sure that open standards and OSS components that we use in our applications are free from vulnerabilities.
Likewise, we will thoroughly test the code that we intend to share.

ESDC already has experience in this area in our cyber security teams and with the cyber security Team at TBS
There are also opportunities to learn and collaborate with the [EU-Free and Open Source Software Auditing (FOSSA)](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eu-fossa-2) community.

### Stay in control

> We promote open standards and specifications that are implemented and distributed in OSS as a way to avoid vendor lock-in.

Interoperability is of utmost importance to ESDC and the GC.
The key to interoperability is the use of well-established standards and specifications.
To ensure our digital sovereignty and guarantee a level playing-field, for all future IT developments ESDC will promote standards and specifications that are implemented and distributed through OSS, and include this in its corporate governance approach.

## 6. Implementing the Strategy

The GC strives to be an enthusiastic user of and contributor to open standards and OSS, as reflected by the Digital Standards and the Policy on Service and Digital.
This "Open First" strategy will ensure that ESDC increases its use of OSS and open standards and by doing so works more in alignment with GC standards and policies.

### Current situation and lessons learned

#### TBS and the Government of Canada

The GC's interest in OSS goes back to the early 2000s when the open source movement mushroomed with the emergence of Mozilla, OpenOffice and investments in Linux development.

In 2004, the GC's position on OSS could be found on TBS’s website.
It was based on the Federated Architecture Program (FAP), which had four principals that applied to OSS:

- reducing integration complexity;
- ensuring security and confidentiality;
- using proven standards and technology; and
- the total cost of ownership.

However, the FAP did not require the adoption or even the evaluation of solutions based on OSS.
There were no directives or guidance in the GC for the use and publication of open standards and OSS.

Some departments put in place their own guidelines or reports on open standards and OSS.
In 2012, the National Research Council (NRC) published the [NRC OSS Guidelines](https://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/NRC_Open_Source_Software_Guidelines) for internal use.
Also in 2012, Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) published an OSS Licensing Primer intended to inform on the importance of interoperability in licensing, and provide with the information and decision-making tools required to make optimal decisions on policy for free and open source use, development and release.
In 2016, Canadian Heritage (PCH) published a report on the [Elements of a Technical Interoperability Framework](https://wiki.gccollab.ca/Elements_of_a_Technical_Interoperability_Framework_for_Canadian_Heritage) to start thinking about how they could increase interoperability and mitigate against vendor lock-in by using open standards and OSS.

Shared Services Canada (SSC), organized two sessions on the topic of OSS with the Architecture Framework Advisory Committee (AFAC) to write a Draft Position on OSS including the following statements:

- For all software acquisitions, open source solutions must be actively and fairly considered alongside proprietary ones;
- Acquisition decisions will be made on the basis of best value and fit to the business requirement, taking account of the total lifetime cost of ownership of the solution, including exit and transition costs; and
- Where there is no significant overall (full-lifecycle) cost difference between open source and non-open source products, open source will be selected on the basis of its additional inherent flexibility.

SSC also published a Functional Direction Software Strategy for departments that included the following principles: Use OSS when feasible; if not, leverage commodity products, and use best value point solutions when deemed necessary.

All these initiatives did not have much impact on the use of OSS and open standards in the GC.
To benefit fully from the advantages of interoperability, strategies need to be implemented across the board, rather than separately in each individual department.

Starting in 2016, there was renewed interest in open standards, OSS and working in the in the GC, leading to international partnerships, standards, policies, directive, mandatory procedures and guidance.
See the [Commitments](#3-commitments) section of this strategy.

#### ESDC

Since 2012, ESDC is responsible for the biggest collaborative OSS project led by the GC.
The [Web Experience Toolkit](https://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew/index-en.html) (WET) is an award-winning front-end framework for building websites that are accessible, usable, interoperable, mobile friendly and multilingual using a collection of flexible and themeable templates and reusable components.
It's the theme being used today on most GC Websites including Canada.ca.

Around the same time that TBS was writing the direction and guidance for open standards and OSS (2018-2019), the Technical Architecture team at ESDC were working on the ESDC OSS Management Framework.
The framework was endorsed at ESDC EARB on March 16th 2021.
One of the main short term recommendations was to establish an OSS Program Office to take on the responsibility and further define the process and reporting requirements.
No further actions have been taken since then.

Some teams in IITB are working in the open (DTS, IT Strategy, ..) and some OSS are part of technical bricks or available, but it's still a minority.

### The right balance

This strategy comes with an action plan that details how ESDC will encourage and leverage open standards and OSS development practices to co-create, share and reuse across the organisation.
In addition to this internal focus on an open working culture, the strategy and action plan provide for increasing outreach to open standards and OSS communities and will help ESDC become a strong force in the community of Canadian public services actively involved in open standards and OSS.

With these internal and external activities, the strategy and action plan constitute practical instruments to help achieve the digital transformation of ESDC.

### Recommendations

#### Open First Centre of Enablement (CoE)

This strategy is firmly rooted in ESDC's and the wider GC policy context.
For it to succeed, a proper enabling environment must be put in place to guide, encourage and nudge change across the organisation.

The strategy and the action plan are inextricably linked.
The pivotal point will be an Open First CoE that enjoys genuine political and organisational support, involving all branches within ESDC.
The CoE will act as facilitator for all activities outlined in the strategy and the action plan.
It will assist subject-matter experts, encourage the branches within ESDC and help balance internal focus and external activities.

As domain leader for IT, IITB will be responsible for setting up and running the CoE.
This will allow it to set priorities, measure outcomes and report on progress.

IITB will make an annual budget request for the CoE and the action plan, to be reviewed and approved through the normal budgetary procedures.
Using the existing corporate IT governance structures, IITB will report on, monitor and review the action plan, and deliver a mid-term review of progress and implementation of the strategy.

Based on the TODO Group (professional open source program networking group at The Linux Foundation) guide on [How to create an open source program](https://todogroup.org/guides/create-program/) the responsibilities of the Open First CoE will include:

- Clearly communicating the Open First strategy within and outside ESDC
- Owning and overseeing the execution of the strategy and action plan
- Facilitating the effective use of open standards and OSS in commercial products and services
- Ensuring high-quality and frequent releases of code to open standards and OSS communities
- Engaging with open communities and seeing that the organisation contributes back to other projects effectively
- Maintaining license compliance, reviews and oversight

The following roles are recommended as a first version of the Open First CoE with 3 FTEs:

1. Program Manager & Compliance Officer - should be empowered as an executive-level position with direct oversight and hands-on management of ESDC's interests in its Open First activities. That would give them the tools they need to lead the way inside ESDC toward its Open First goals and vision. Also tasked with the mission of ensuring open standards and OSS compliance.
2. Legal Advisor - must have a say in the operations of the CoE to ensure compliance with laws, licensing agreements, and other legal details. Specific to open standards and OSS, the legal advisor needs to be responsible for ensuring that ESDC can consume code internally and contribute back to projects with acceptable terms.
3. Evangelist & Developer Relations - work to build interest and enthusiasm within ESDC's developer community for specific projects, which can help grow the efforts and increase teamwork among engineers.

The CoE will expedite and be responsible for all activities in the action plan.

#### Actions and impact

The best way to lead is by example.
This strategy will rapidly produce tangible evidence of the benefits of a working culture based on open principles.
In addition, by simplifying the rules on sharing ESDC software and contributing to OSS projects, it will prove the value of open standards and OSS to the organisation and to society at large.

These are the main actions:

| Actions | Impact |
|---|---|
| Set, encourage and promote the inner source | Enable co-creation and collaboration |
| Enhance the software repository | Enable co-creation and collaboration |
| Revise software distribution practices | Process simplification; lower cost to society |
| Enable and create innovation with open standards and OSS labs | Drive innovation; encourage co-creation |
| Develop skills and recruit expertise | Contribute to staff recruitment and retention |
| Increase outreach to communities | Encourage innovation; improve services |
| Integrate open standards and OSS in internal IT governance | Increase organisational efficiency; foster innovation |
| Ensure security | Increase value of open standards and OSS to the organisation and society |
| Launch and fund open standards and OSS projects | Wide collaboration; community building |

These actions will provide the tools to reinforce and extend the open-source working culture.
Our source code will gradually become available to all developer teams in ESDC and the Government of Canada.
We will also be able to contribute to the tools on which we depend.
This will help prepare us to accept contributions to our own work from outside the organisation.

We will make sure that the OSS reused by ESDC is free from security vulnerabilities.
Similarly, we will include in our security testing all of the code that we make available as OSS.
The open-source working methods and tools will be available to interested colleagues and we will help them try out innovative open-source solutions.
We can focus on recruiting staff with proven open-source expertise and strengthen ties with open-source communities, by organising joint activities and finding practical ways to help projects achieve sustainability.

When selecting new IT solutions, we will put more emphasis on the role of open standards and OSS.
By balancing immediate technology needs and future flexibility, we can take account of sovereignty, openness and long-term interests.

To make sure these actions are executed in an organised, coordinated and scheduled manner, the strategy establishes a small CoE.
It will liaise between projects, teams and subject-matter experts, and encourage the organisation on its path towards an open working culture.
