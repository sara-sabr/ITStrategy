## 1. Document Purpose

This document seeks to explain, in non-policy and non-planning language, the problems that the Target IT Solution Delivery Model strategy intends to solve.

It will do so by:

1. Providing a strategic context to situate the reader  
2. Providing a list of problem statements and how the strategy intends
    to solve them

## 2. Strategic Context

This section situates the purpose of the strategy within the digital government environment, that is within an environment that seeks to reconcile user needs, agility, and an enterprise view of technology investments.

The scope of this strategy is IT Solution Delivery.
Not asset management, vendor sourcing, workforce and talent management, or enterprise capability-based planning.

### 2.1. Where are we now?

- APM landscape (\# of apps, mission criticality, end of life)[^1]
- IITB Way Forward
- Cloud Implementation
- Governance
- Finance
- SDLC and SSC's INET
- BDM

### 2.2. Where do we want to be?

Same day software deployments are possible and a common practice at ESDC.
The benefits to frequent small deployments, using automated methods, are expected to reduce risk[^2], reduce technical debt, increase client satisfaction, and increase overall confidence in the department and its staff.

### 2.3. What has triggered the need for change?

- Digital (Policy and Standard)
- Ubiquitous nature of technology in service delivery
- Pace of business change
- Pace of technology change
- Cyber Security

## 3. Problem Statements

### 3.1. IT Projects health does not measure business value

#### 3.1.1. Problem Description

A Project is a temporary endeavour undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result[^3].
An ***IT*** ***Project*** is about a software product to enhance business operations service or results.
Whether or not the result proved to be positive is currently not part of the IT Project's health measurement.

IT Projects health is currently measured by costs, scheduled, and scope.
The health being adjusted whether the IT Project is within cost estimates, within planned schedule, and within agreed upon scope.
These indicators can be modified via change requests where an IT Project's health originally red (bad) moves to green (good) by agreeing to move originally estimated cost/schedule/cost accordingly.

The larger the IT Project is, the longer the business operations need to wait for the results expected of that IT Project to materialize.
And as such, the longer it is for the organization to determine whether or not the investment was worthwhile.

A Business case (idea for an investment) needs to be treated as a hypothesis, validated only when it reached end-users.
Anything in between is purely corporate management and not end-user focused.

#### 3.1.2. How the strategy intends to solve the problem

- Mandate a size limit to IT Project sizes
- Treat IT Project as an iteration step for an agile organization
- Simplify IT project reporting to focus on value over time (development value stream KPI)
- Simplify IT Project creation (See problem statement \#3.2)

### 3.2. Labour-intensive IT Project creation process acts as a deterrent for change

#### 3.2.1. Problem Description

Creating an IT Project requires intensive labour work which produces an unintended consequence: acting as a deterrent for change.

To create an IT Project, the project sponsor is required to produce a Project Management Plan (PMP) which expects the following series of subsidiary plans (non-exhaustive list):

1. Scope Management Plan
1. Schedule Management Plan
1. Cost Management Plan
1. Resource Management Plan
1. Quality Management Plan

Most software work will be new (i.e. not under run costs) as software evolves over time, adjusting to end-user's behaviours, the market, and ongoing business change.
Permission to do such software work depends on creating an IT Project.
Due to the labour-intensive IT Project creation process, small changes to software will not be justified.
We end up piling such changes over time until we have enough that justifies going through the IT Project creation process.
This leads to the following unintentional consequences:

- Big software deployments, increasing risk to the organization.
- Locking IT resources for too long, leading lines of businesses to fight between themselves for attention of IT personnel
- Once lines of businesses finally have the IT Personnel's attention, they are motivated to add as much requirements as possible ("it took me years to get your attention, I will take this opportunity to add as much changes as I can")

#### 3.2.2. How the strategy intends to solve the problem

- Mandate size limit to IT Project sizes
- Programme can be used to manage large ambition, while segmenting such ambition into smaller IT Project sizes.
- Deploy DevOps teams to IT Projects, not assembling persons into new teams
- Use of new Agile governance framework
- Simplify IT project reporting to focus on value over time, changing ESDC's standard for project management
- Budget IT Products so small changes to them do not need IT Project creation

### 3.3. Functional organization structures create siloes and territorial behaviours

#### 3.3.1. Problem Description

- Organization is structured by functions -- siloes
- Perceived Ownership of a function promotes siloes and reduces knowledge sharing
- SDLC complexity (SAs release process)

#### 3.3.2. How the strategy intends to solve the problem

- Deploy DevOps teams
- DevOps team expected to take on all functional responsibilities
- Use of Champions to augment team's skillsets and expertise
- Use of specialized tools (e.g. security) to reduce burden to teams

### 3.4. Functional organization structures hinder capacity planning

#### 3.4.1. Problem Description

- Organization structure by functions -- siloes
- Project costing complexity (multiple cost centres)
- SDLC complexity (SAs release process)
- Section "[the problem of traditional project cost accounting](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/lean-budgets/)" from from SAFe

#### 3.4.2. How the strategy intends to solve the problem

- Deploy DevOps teams
- DevOps team expected to take on all functional responsibilities

### 3.5. Governance layers impede innovation and produce cost of delays

#### 3.5.1. Problem Description

- Decisions to proceed requires committee intervention
- IT teams are at the mercy of committees' meeting frequency and planned agenda
- Additional labour is needed to produce information packages for each committee
- Critical functions have their importance reduced due to deadlines and deterrent to course correct (e.g. Cyber Security and Architecture)

#### 3.5.2. How the strategy intends to solve the problem

- Delegation of authority to IT teams
- Smaller changes to reduce risks of change
- Automation of software deployment (testing and releases)
- Governance adjusted to focus on monitoring and course correction instead of gating

### 3.6. Manual Audit processes (compliance) impede innovation and create cost of delays

#### 3.6.1. Problem Description

- Internal Audit (e.g. pay system)
- SA&A
- Accessibility
- Audit requirements become a factor that limits innovation (i.e. to innovate, you must change the audit requirement)

#### 3.6.2. How the strategy intends to solve the problem

- Compliance audit processes adjusted to favour and incentivize automation
- DevOps teams used instead of individuals

### 3.7. Technology deployments take too long to reach production

#### 3.7.1. Problem Description

- Access to production is denied (legacy)
- Too many functional teams involved in the SDLC creating \~41 context switches
- Segregation of duties does not favour release automation

#### 3.7.2. How the strategy intends to solve the problem

- DevOps teams
- Pipeline automation

### 3.8. Lack of business commitments impedes problem solving during project execution

#### 3.8.1. Problem Description

Lines of Businesses start a project but are unable to commit full time subject matter experts during the execution phase of the project, including policy experts.
The execution phase is where the rubber hits the road and unexpected challenges are raised to the surface that require problem solving in partnership with lines of businesses (e.g. policy requirement conflicts, business rules ambiguity, unexpected scenarios affecting the end-users).

#### 3.8.2. How the strategy intends to solve the problem

- Mandated minimum commitments as part of the PMLC

### 3.9. IT teams do not have authority over their own budgets, leading to accumulation of technical debt and cost of delays

#### 3.9.1. Problem Description

- IT teams require to do forecasting instead of be given a budget to manage.
Forecasting is based on expected projects (some committed, some estimated, some only talked about).
Forecasting leads to a lot of guesses and anxiety over how much a particular team can commit to.
Some directors will be risk averse and only forecast to what has been committed, others will take on risks and forecast what is believed will eventually materialize as a project.
- Forecasting requires to constantly justify spending, often via briefing notes and tedious storytelling about "what is the benefit to the citizen".
- Technology change needing the creation of IT Project
- Software treated as a physical asset that does not evolve over time
- Technical debt is COTS versioning, patching, but also skillsets, refactoring engineering and architecture decisions
- Changes to IT Products require initiating IT Projects which are labour intensive (statement \#3.2)

#### 3.9.2. How the strategy intends to solve the problem

- Minimum funding of IT Products until decommissioning
- Budgeted teams
- More team autonomy (loose coupling architecture, access to deploy in prod)

### 3.10. Manual data collection leads to inadequate insights to IT Product's health

#### 3.10.1 Problem Description

- APM process and TBS expectations
- Production data collection

#### 3.10.2. How the strategy intends to solve the problem

- IT teams have access to production via pipelines
- Mandatory release of product metrics internally to ESDC

### 3.11. Inability to experiment and insufficient architectural authority leads to sticking with what we know (legacy technologies)

#### 3.11.1. Problem Description

- We stick with what we know instead of what is easier.
E.g. file exchanges instead of moving to APIs
- What we know sounds easier to do now, but it is actually more difficult than the modern way.
This complexity and its cost is delegated to a later time and often to downstream teams that must suffer the burden of this decision.
- Architecture standards are not being followed
- Architecture committees over complicates the need in looking to forecast the future problems, leading to clients unwilling to be part of the discussion

#### 3.11.2. How the strategy intends to solve the problem

- Mandating loose coupling architectures
- Mandating the use of APIs
- Providing DevOps teams with means to experiment
- Providing DevOps teams with ability to deploy to production
- Providing a more clear line of sight between loose coupling boundaries and Business Capability Model to facilitate Architecture committee discussions
- Re-scoping the technical bricks to allow non-standard technical stacks to be used
