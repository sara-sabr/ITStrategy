<div class="team-intro">
<p>This website is a platform where we, IT Strategy, are sharing our plan for becoming a digital government, our progress, and all the tools, information and other resources needed to support this transformation across IITB and ESDC as a whole. It is a place that gives us an opportunity to express our professional opinion and ideas.</p>
<p>The ESDC IT Strategy team is working in the open and welcomes any feedback while work is still in progress. Contributing to work in progress is framing our learning experience and differs from formal committee reviews that most government employees are familiar with. Working in the open is a culture and way of thinking. It is exposing our work and not keeping it in a silo . To keep our work more visible we chose GitHub as opposed to typical internal records management system because GitHub is available on the Internet and makes use of Git. It also let us work together on projects from anywhere.</p>
<p>We are working on projects openly, blogging about what we are working on and what we are learning. This is important because it helps us connect with other people who are working on similar challenges, builds trust and confidence in the work weâ€™re doing and generally makes things better. Some of our team members are actively sharing their thoughts and getting feedback and comments from a big audience on Twitter.</p>
<p>Finally, we are a fun team and through many team-building activities we have built a sense of trust among teammates that allows us to bring the full power of our skills, personalities, and who we are to work.</p>
