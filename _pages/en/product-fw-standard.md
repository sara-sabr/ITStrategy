    <p>
This document <strong>does NOT</strong> attempt to explain all aspects of Product Management (such as vision setting, user research, and the different phases a product goes through in its life cycle).
These are well documented already, such as on <a href="https://www.pmi.org/disciplined-agile/process/product-management">PMI.org</a> and <a href="https://community.pdma.org/knowledgehub/home">PDMA.org</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Instead, this documents seeks to provide structure to ESDC Programs and IITB in the <strong>transition</strong> from project to product, <strong>within a government context</strong>.
    In particular, the methods to <strong>fund cross-functional and cross-branch product teams</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Directive and Standard strive to be as succinct and to the point as possible, without repeating rules in existing policy instruments that teams are expected to comply with (such as Financial and Security). To help the reader understand the rationale behind them and provide guidance in implementing them, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/product-fw-guidance.html">this Guidance document has been written</a>.

This standard is issued pursuant the authority indicated in the [PILOT IITB Directive on Product Management](product-fw-directive.html).

## Standards

The following standards are used pursuant the [PILOT IITB Directive on Product Management](product-fw-directive.html).

### Head of Product Role

The Head of Product oversees all of the product-related work that the Product Team does.
It's the person at the top of all other internal or smaller products making up the main Product the team is ultimately responsible for.

A Head of Product is expected to be executive level due to the oversight and responsibilities expected of it.

The Head of Product performs the following activities:

- Coordinates with product managers and other product teams
- Briefs senior management on the Product-related information
- Performs the various departmental governance requirements

### Product Manager Role

The Product Manager is a strategic role.
Will typically look at a time horizon beyond 3-6 months.
It's the person assigned responsibility for overseeing all of the various activities that concern a particular product.

The Product Manager performs the following activities:

- Ensures alignment of the Product to the Program's goals and the department's overall strategy.
- Defines the product vision and strategy
- Gathers, manages, and prioritizes client requirements
- Works closely with IT Managers to vet the realistic and technical natures of the product's strategy and roadmaps, such as including software patching requirements to mitigate cyber security risks
- Works closely with the Product Owner and team members to ensure business case and client satisfaction goals are met
- Produces different types of Product Roadmaps depending on the audience
- Negotiates with Project Managers on Product Team's commitments
- Performs various HR activities for the Product Team (e.g. staffing, coaching, mentoring)
- Secures funding through business case(s) and through good pitch in government
- Ensures the Product Team is equipped for success (e.g. procuring tools, training)
- Understands the different phases of product delivery

The above taken from [Product Development and Management Association](https://www.pdma.org/?)'s Body of Knowledge second edition, from [280group](https://280group.com/what-is-product-management/roles/product-manager/), [GOV.uk's guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/product-manager).

### Product Owner Role

The Product Owner is a tactical role.
Will typically look at a time horizon within 3-6 months.
The Product Owner interfaces with, and engages the business stakeholders.

The Product Owner is the final authority for decisions regarding priority, business value, and functionality for the work done by the Product Development team.

The Product Owner performs the following activities:

- Acts as a fully integrated team member
- Uses clear goals to communicate the internal project (release scope) vision at the beginning of every release so that the team understands and is equipped to realize it
- Makes business decisions and clearly communicates through requirements elaboration techniques (e.g. epics and user stories) so they are understood
- Works closely with IT Managers in taking the technical aspect of each release scope
- Ensures compliance with IM/IT-related Treasury Board Directives such as Cyber Security software patching
- Communicates status outside the team

The above from [Info-Tech Research Group](https://www.infotech.com/research/it-product-owner).

### IT Security Champion Role

The IT Security Champion is the go-to-person for IT Security knowledge about the product.

The IT Security Champion performs the following activities:

- Understands the security tools
- Implements security tools in the pipeline
- Analyzes security test results
- Mitigates identified risks in software-based products
- Promotes and coaches the team members on security best practices

The above from [SLF's January 2021 presentation](https://014gc.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/DGIIT-Gouvernance-IITB-Governance/SLFFCS/DevSecOps SLF-EN.pptx?d=wc4a2579808df446eab5b3b5b3ceedb5f&csf=1&web=1&e=VVS26e) (modified last point)

### Change Coordinator Role

The Change Coordinator ensures that all changes are managed in a controlled manager, including standard changes and emergency maintenance.

The Change Coordinator performs the following activities:

- Performs impact assessments
- Seeks the necessary authorisations prior to the change (e.g. IITB Release Process)
- Ensures all stakeholders are aware of the upcoming product release
- Documents the change

The above from [Info-Tech Research Group](https://www.infotech.com/research/change-manager).

### Product Support Manager Role

The Product Support Manager is the go to person for any questions or issues relating to the product's support.

The Product Support Manager performs the following activities:

- Establishes the product support process and procedures, both for internal support (within the department) and for external support (Canadians or other departments using the product, if applicable).
- Is the first point of contact for issue resolution
- Assesses the priority and severity of issues affecting the product
- Prioritizes issue resolution based on priority and severity
- Liaise with IITB's Software Product Specialists, if need be, when COTS software product are being used

### Product Team Organizational Structure

The Product Team Organizational Structure represents the cross-branch Org Chart of the product team.

It identifies which positions, from the ESDC branches involved, that makes up the Product Team.

### Product Team Governance Structure

The Product Team's Governance Structure explains how decisions affecting the product are managed.
A governance structure will typically contain committees and individuals performing specific roles (such as the relationships between the different roles mentioned above).
The Governance structure also explains how certain decisions may be delegated.

### Product Roadmap Executive View

The Product Roadmap Executive View represents, in a timeline, the different milestones in the product's releases.

The Product Roadmap Executive View is the main artefact that Corporate Oversight will use to evaluate value for money when investing in a product team.

The Product Roadmap Executive View includes the following information:

- A Fiscal Year view, by month, of the product's timespan
- Each milestone expected in the year (estimated month of release)
- A brief summary of the outcomes sought for each milestone

Visual representations can be inspired from [these templates](https://roadmunk.com/roadmap-templates).

### Release Impact Analysis

At every release, the Product Team does a retrospection after an adequate amount of time has passed to analyse the impact of that release towards its desired outcome(s). The retrospection includes the following information:

| Information Element             | Description                                |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|

| Analysis                        | Analysis evaluating the expected outcome(s) of the Release, whether positive or negative, sustained by evidence|

### Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)

The Memorandum of Understanding is the agreement between the CIO (senior ADM of IITB) and other Branche(s) in transferring funds to assign dedicated IT Staff to a particular product team.

Information to be added in the MOU and the template to use is as follows (adjusted from [TBS Guidelines on Service Agreements](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25761)):

<p><strong>1.	Recitals</strong></p>
<p>
Whereas &lt;Branch A&gt; has the authority, capacity, and expertise to deliver &lt;Service Name XYZ&gt; as part of &lt;Program name XYZ&gt; and IITB has the authority, capacity, and expertise to develop, operate, host, and assess software against the Information Management and Information Technology (IM/IT) regulations of the Treasury Board (TB) Directive on Service and Digital and the TB Directive on Security Management, therefore IITB agrees to provide &lt;Branch A&gt; with IT staff that will be dedicated to &lt;Branch A&gt;'s delivery of &lt;Service Name XYZ&gt;.
</p>
<p>
&lt;Branch A&gt; will transfer an amount equal to &lt;&#36;&#36;&#36;&#36;&#36;&#36;&gt; on a yearly basis to IITB. This amount will be used to staff IT personnel and pay public cloud hosting fees (if necessary).
</p>
<p>IITB will be consulted to estimate the yearly IT Budget.</p>

<p>The IT Staff will remain in IITB. Their performance assessment will reflect both &lt;Service Name XYZ&gt;'s  delivery and IITB's expectations.</p>

<p>The term âProduct Teamâ in this document refers to the members of the team that will be formed by including the &lt;Branch A&gt;'s staff and the dedicated IITB staff, as documented using the IITB Directive on Product Management.</p>

<p><strong>2. Commencement and Duration</strong></p>

<p>This Agreement will commence on &lt;YYYY-MM-DD&gt; and will be reviewed [each year, each 4 years, on YYYY-MM-DD]</p>

<p><strong>3. Mutual Vision, Strategy, and Outcomes</strong></p>

<p>[This section develops a common vision and associated business strategies to ensure the parties are aligned with the mutual vision and strategies as negotiations evolve. This section should identify the outcomes expected from the establishment of a relationship and their linkage to the business objectives of the department]</p>

<p>The move to Digital puts software as part of service delivery as the products enabling the service are more and more software-based. Some of those software-based products are exposed to service consumers (e.g. a website). The use of software brings new opportunities for rapid service improvements as interactions with software generates large amount of data. This data is insights that can be used for evidence-based decision making, to improve existing business processes, enhance user experience, and continuously address cyber security risks.</p>

<p>To capitalize on this opportunity, smaller and more continuous changes in software should be enabled and facilitated. Funding cross-functionally skilled âproduct teamsâ enables collaboration amongst the different expertise traditionally segregated in organizational charts.</p>

<p>[narrate how this will specifically benefit the Program and the services it delivers to Canadian. Recommend using the Programs Performance Information Profile's desired outcomes, ESDC's Service Strategy and its Service Target Operating Model, and using an agile approach of trying, evaluating, and course correcting to navigate ambiguity].</p>

<p><strong>4.	Purpose and Objectives</strong></p>

<p>[This section defines the specific intent of the service relationship being formed and the expected outcomes for all parties to the agreement. Should tie back to the Program's Performance Information Profile and it's target outcomes. In addition, IM/IT Cyber Security and technical debt risk remediation may be added for value co-creation between IITB and &lt;Branch A&gt;]</p>

<p>Projects initiated outside of the Product Team's circle, such as transformational agenda and legislation changes, still exist and are expected to engage with the Product Team's Head of Product to negotiate commitments and product team's capacity challenges.</p>

<p>Integrity rules in the use of public funds and in software delivery are expected to remain, such as release management and cyber security assessments. In that spirit, project management discipline, information management, and cyber threat modeling expertise is expected to be embedded in the product team and will be monitored by the behaviours expected to be manifested from complying with the IITB Directive on Product Management.</p>

<p><strong>5.	Reference to Supporting Documents of Related Agreements</strong></p>

### Product Team's Software Performance Metrics

The following software performance metrics are produced by the product team to measure the effectiveness that working under a cross-functional product team has over continuous product improvements.
In particular, that the Product Manager and Product Owner take sufficient attention on the risks that creeping technical debt, team morale, and cyber security has on the overall quality and effectiveness of the product team.

The metrics are compiled and made available each month.

- **Deployment Frequency**: How often the product team successfully releases to production
- **Lead Time for Changes**: The amount of time it takes a code commit to get into production (software pipeline delivery)
- **Change Failure Rate**: The percentage of deployments causing a failure in production
- **Time to Restore Service**: How long it takes the product team to recover from a failure in production

Taken from the [DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) Key Metrics](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/using-the-four-keys-to-measure-your-devops-performance).

### Risk Register

A risk register is a document that documents risks related to the product(s) and the mitigation plan for each.
The Risk Register may be used by as evidence that risk management is being performed by the product team.

Each risks in the register contains, at minimum, the following element:

| Information Element             | Description                                |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Risk Statement                  | A written statement about the risk. Typically in the form of<br><i>Given that â¦. , there is a risk that â¦., which will lead toâ¦</li>|
| Likelihood                      | The probability that a risk may materialize. Typically using a scale such as:<br>1: very low probability<br>2: low probability<br>3: moderate probability<br>4: high probability<br>5: almost certain|
| Impact                          | The effects that the risk will have on business operations, or performance indicators, if it materializes (e.g. financial impact, client satisfaction, media coverage, legal implications). Typically using a scale such as:<br>1: negligible<br>2: minor<br>3: moderate<br>4: severe<br>5: catastrophic|
| Severity                        | Likelihood times impact. Typically shown in a two by two matrix such as:<br> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/risk-severity-matrix.png" alt="A two by two matrix that have 25 boxes. The ones on the bottom left are green because the risk is low, the ones in the middle are yellow because the risk is medium, the ones on the top right are red because they represents high risk. There is a star in the middle representing where the severity in this example is">|
| Risk Strategy                   | The response to the risk. Typically one of:<br>â¢ Monitor: Accept the current level of risk and continue to monitor it.<br>â¢ Transfer: Transfer the risk or part of it to another branch or organization.<br>â¢ Avoid: Stop the activity to avoid the possibility of risk.<br>â¢ Mitigate: Plan and implement measures to reduce the risk or improve operations.<br>â¢ Prepare: Create and maintain response plans to be implemented if risk materializes.<br>â¢ Exploit: Accept the risk to provide opportunities for enhanced effectiveness.|
| Mitigation Activities           | Mitigations deemed necessary based on the Risk Strategy |
