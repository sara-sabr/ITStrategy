## Vision (image of the future)

The [Canadian Experience](human-development-life-cycle.html) is when Canadians are benefiting seamlessly of the federal government services through modern technologies.

Continuous improvement transformation and GC wide "Government as a service" based on [GC Digital Standards](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html) and the [Directive on Service and Digital](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32601). See [Medium Term IT Picture - 2025](it-picture-medium-term.html) and [Long Term IT Picture - 2030](it-picture-long-term.html).

## Mission (team's reason for existence)

Enable the strategic value of IT within ESDC by reducing its risks and increasing business agility.

## Mandate (team's authority within IITB)

- Diagnose key organizational problems, waste, lead times and governance structures that inhibit the desired changes in behaviours
- Recommend specific course of actions to governance bodies to adopt new methods of managing IT risks
- Measure progress of adoption of strategies in IT teams and governance bodies as a performance indicator of the IT Strategy team
- Challenge current thinking and approaches

## Team's Guiding Principles

## Work collaboratively

Collaborate with anyone and everyone who can _add value_.
This includes, but is not limited to, all Canadians, levels of government, departments, private sector organizations, and governments.

## Continuous learning

Learning is a core part of daily activities to ensure up to date, modern, and well-researched direction.

## Lead by Example

By using the approaches and technologies we champion, we are able to better respond and anticipate potential challenges.
We also experiment with modern ways of working in order to demonstrate their value and effectiveness.

## Team understanding of the "digital transformation"

IT is now used to deliver services to Canadians.
If IT fails, business fails and vice versa.
The use of technology is no longer "an IT problem" as it has real repercussions to citizens.
IT can no longer be seen as a company within another company (or an outside supplier), it has shared accountability with the organization's mandate and is a strategic asset.

Current IT processes and governance methods are risky and costly, which translates into long time to deliver or change applications, devices and support.
Recovering from incidents is hard and errors resulting from changes are frequent.
We must reduce risks associated with IT and continuously improve in all of its areas.

That is **Digital Transformation**.

It's an ongoing venture due to the rapid pace of change in the IT world.
It has no end date.
It never ends.
