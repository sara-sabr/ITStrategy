## Vision (image of the future)

The [Canadian Experience](https://github.com/sara-sabr/ITStrategy/blob/master/Strategies/HumanDevelopmentLifeCycle.md) is when Canadians are benefiting seamlessly of the federal government services through modern technologies.

## Mission (team's reason for existence)

Be the catalysts of change within IITB to lay the path for the evolution of ESDC's digital services.

## Mandate (team's authority within IITB)

- Diagnose key ESDC organisational problems
- Identify recommended course of action to any ESDC governance body
- Measure progress of strategies implementation against approved key performance
- Access and review any ESDC information and documentation as they pertain to process efficiency
- Challenge current thinking and approaches

## Team's Guiding Principles

### Work collaboratively

Collaborate with anyone and everyone who can _add value_.
This includes, but is not limited to, all Canadians, all levels of government, all departments, all private sector organizations, and all governments.

### Continuous learning

Learning must be a core part of daily activities to ensure up to date, modern, and well researched direction and strategy is provided to guide our actions.

### Lead by Example

By using the approaches and technologies we champion, we will be able to better respond to, and anticipate, the challenges that will be faced.
We will also be experimenting with modern ways of working in order to demonstrate their value and effectiveness.
