### **Team's Guiding Principles**  

- Work collaboratively

We collaborate with anyone and everyone who can _add value_.
This includes, but is not limited to, all Canadians, levels of government, departments, private sector organizations, and governments.

- Continuous learning

Learning is a core part of daily activities to ensure up to date, modern, and well-researched direction.

- Lead by Example

By using the approaches and technologies we champion, we are able to better respond and anticipate potential challenges.
We also experiment with modern ways of working in order to demonstrate their value and effectiveness.

- Teamwork

We swarm to solve problems and respond to requests, we have our own files but we also work across files sharing our expertise to help one another

- Working in the open

We strongly believe in sharing our work openly on this website.
We include here not just final products but also products in development so that we can collaborate and improve our work and also so that our work can be re-used by anyone

### **Team understanding of the "digital transformation"**

IT is now used to deliver services to Canadians.
If IT fails, business fails and vice versa.
The use of technology is no longer "an IT problem" as it has real repercussions to citizens.
IT can no longer be seen as a company within another company (or an outside supplier), it has shared accountability with the organization's mandate and is a strategic asset.

Current IT processes and governance methods are risky and costly, which translates into long time to deliver or change applications, devices and support.
Recovering from incidents is hard and errors resulting from changes are frequent.
We must reduce risks associated with IT and continuously improve in all of its areas.

That is **Digital Transformation**.

It's an ongoing venture due to the rapid pace of change in the IT world.
It has no end date.
It never ends.
