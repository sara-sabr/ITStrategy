## Team's Guiding Principles

### Work collaboratively

We collaborate with anyone and everyone who can _add value_.
This includes, but is not limited to, all Canadians, levels of government, departments, private sector organizations, and governments.

### Continuous learning

Learning is a core part of daily activities to ensure up to date, modern, and well-researched direction.

### Lead by Example

By using the approaches and technologies we champion, we are able to better respond and anticipate potential challenges.
We also experiment with modern ways of working in order to demonstrate their value and effectiveness.

### Teamwork

We swarm to solve problems and respond to requests, we have our own files but we also work across files sharing our expertise to help one another

### Working in the open

We strongly believe in sharing our work openly on this website.
We include here not just final products but also products in development so that we can collaborate and improve our work and also so that our work can be re-used by anyone.
