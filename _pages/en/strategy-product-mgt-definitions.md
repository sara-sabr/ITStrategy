- [Inventory of known definitions of "Product"](#inventory-of-known-definitions-of-product)

This document seeks to clarify what will be the definition of “Product” for ESDC.

A clear definition, accepted by both “IT” and “The Business”, is necessary to set the right expectations, reduce confusion, and ensure alignment of efforts.

## ESDC Definition of "Product"

3 reasons why there needs to be an IT “hook” in the definition:

1. The [Policy on service and digital](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32603) requires departmental integrated plans to [identify the apps in the APM portfolio that are being invested in](https://gcconnex.gc.ca/discussion/view/72865810/dpsd-guide-1-0-for-integrated-planning-guide-pmsn-1-0-pour-le-plan-integre?language=en). APM is already an established methodology with TBS.
2. Software has a unique characteristic: it’s elastic (this is what Cloud gives us). The marginal costs of changing software is low and warrants adjusting our planning methods.
3. If the definition is too BROAD, it is meaningless. To mean something for IT, it needs to have a technology meaning.

The IT Strategy’s Product Management Strategy proposal considers the above three points. If those change, its proposal may not be relevant.

May consider using a different term like “Digital Product”...
