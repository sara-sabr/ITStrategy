## IT Vision Picture - Medium Term

This is a working document to help create a picture of what will IITB look in the medium term for ESDC.

In the following sections, we're trying to take the same end state and create "views" where different audiences would be looking at ESDC and see different things.

- [Citizen](#citizen)
  - [Automatic Enrollment and Delivery](#automatic-enrollment-and-delivery)
  - [Self-Service](#self-service)
  - [Service Centres and Outreach](#service-centres-and-outreach)
- [Private Sector](#private-sector)
  - [Any platform, any device, 3rd party integration](#any-platform-any-device-3rd-party-integration)
  - [Open Collaboration](#open-collaboration)
- [IITB-ESDC](#iitb-esdc)
  - [Modern Open Organization](#modern-open-organization)
  - [Project Quarterly Delivery](#project-quarterly-delivery)
  - [Modern Development Tools](#modern-development-tools)
  - [Strong Culture of Learning](#strong-culture-of-learning)
- [ESDC Programs](#esdc-programs)
- [Government Partners](#government-partners)
- [References](#references)

### Citizen

#### Automatic Enrollment and Delivery

It must be a priority to move towards the long-term vision of a fully automated enrollment process for citizens who opt to use the service. As a stepping stone, it must be a priority to allow for a policy similar to ['Once-Only' from the European Union](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-wide-digital-once-only-principle-citizens-and-businesses-policy-options-and-their-impacts) to be implemented. This means that IITB must ensure information can be securely and digitally exchanged throughout the information technology infrastructure. In order to enable such initiatives, which would enable IITB and citizens alike to avoid constant rework, IITB must be permitted and promoted to allocate significantly more resources to continuous process and technology improvements. We explore this requirement in more detail below in the [Modern Open Organization](#Modern Open Organization) section.

#### Self-Service

- Centralized login for all ESDC services
- Application processes should be simple and guided.
  - Pages with scrollable instructions outlining details of the application process are a relic of the past.

#### Service Centres and Outreach

- Humans should focus on interacting with other humans through outreach. Repetitive processes should be handled through computation.

- Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (TODO: How does this impact the citizen?)
- Some services (TODO: which?) are accessible using services I am already familiar with (Ex: My Bank)

### Private Sector

#### Any platform, any device, 3rd party integration

- Small businesses should start to innovate using ESDC data sets published through the Open API Store

#### Open Collaboration

- Small businesses should start to innovate using ESDC data sets published through the Open API Store

### IITB-ESDC

#### Modern Open Organization

- IITB strictly controls 20% of it's funding for Internal IT Projects
- IITB is involved in business discussions and decisions (TODO: Are we now? What body should we be apart of, and who should be a part of it?)
- 75% of employees are equipped with mobile devices allowing them to work from anywhere (TODO: Map trends and profiles on to metric )
- Flexible work arrangements where employees may work remotely, insofar as it does not impact their ability to perform in their role
- Employees are empowered to continuously learn through self directed learning. Management must allow at least 1 hour per day per employee to be spent learning new, or developing existing, skills
- Employees are sharing their experiences and best practices (Tech Talks)
- Open by Default Development Policy
  - Justification required as to why a project is not being developed in the open
- All newly architected solutions must communicate through APIs
- [Cloud Smart](https://cloud.cio.gov/strategy/)
  - Projects by default must use the cloud. Justification required if the project is not intending to use the cloud
  - (TODO: Validate) Modern trends are retracting from full public cloud offerings and solutions are beginning to expand in the 'on-prem cloud' space. IITB needs to take a smart cloud approach, rather than simplify a public cloud first approach.
- (TODO: What does EAs role look like in 5 years? Sources and references [CDS or 18f, for example])

#### Modern Development Tools

- Development teams have access to modern development tools needed to keep pace with industry best practices.

#### Strong Culture of Learning

Becoming a Modern Open Organization implies a strong culture of learning. Here's the 2 main categories of employee learning:

- Formal Training (e.g. classroom)
- Informal Learning

Formal training being a mature and well-recognized practice, ESDC will need to focus on understanding and encouraging informal learning among employees. Especially as [recent estimates suggest](https://www.groupoe.com/images/Accelerating_On-the-Job-Learning_-_White_Paper.pdf) that between 70% to 80% of all job-related knowledge isn't learned in formal training but rather **informally** on-the-job. We observe that formal training hasn't been designed to provide employees with the "on demand" learning they need to maintain current knowledge and proficiency.

> **Informal learning** is any learning that is not formal learning or non-formal learning, such as self-directed learning or learning from experience. [...] it has no set objective in terms of learning outcomes and is never intentional from the learner's standpoint. [...] this includes heuristic language building, socialization, enculturation, and play.  
> Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_learning)

One important characteristic of informal learning is that it does not follow a specified curriculum and is not often professionally organized. It rather originates **accidentally**, **sporadically**, in association with **certain occasions**, from changing practical requirements. Also, it has been associated with increased individual, organizational, and market performance.

Some examples of informal learning:

- Self-selected books or Self-study programs;
- Incidental skills practise;
- Having a coach or mentor;
- Seeking advice from peers; and
- Participation in communities of practice.

This culture change will require many adjustments at all levels of the organization and a strong support from senior management. Along with internal HR-related improvements, it will also extend to modernizing external hiring practices.

### ESDC Departmental Clients

#### IITB Responsiveness

IITB will be able to more quickly address multiple projects throughout the year by implementing a quarterly production release (at the very latest), for all projects. By adhering to an agile deployment methodology and a product management approach, the highest business value should be delivered early on in the project and made available to clients after each quarter. As the circumstances change, this problem may then either be worked on for another iteration (one quarter) or, if the relationship between time committed and business value gained would decline compared to other projects competing for resources, then another project made be onboarded for the proceeding quarter. For further details regarding the case for quarterly deployments, please refer to our [documentation](./quarterly-delivery.md).
