### GC Wide

The foundational pieces for "Government as a service" vision are available and in production, based on the [Digital Operations Strategic Plan: 2018-2022 Timeline](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-operations-strategic-plan-2018-2022.html#ToC15). This includes:

- Trusted digital identity for public-facing services (Sign-in Canada);
- Horizontal review on information-sharing - eliminate roadblocks (Tell us once);
- Build a platform for enterprise interoperability (API Store and Tell us once);
- One GC vision and Omni Channel Digital Strategy (Any device, any platform, any partner).

[The GC Digital Standards](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html), [the Policy](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32603) and [Directive on Service and Digital](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32601), with the [Mandatory Procedures for Enterprise Architecture Assessment](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32602) have shifted GC departments and agencies are increasingly using open standards (data formats and protocols) and existing open source software.
Being agile and focusing on the needs of the user is the new normal and there growing collaboration via open source software communities within and outside the GC.
Organizations have migrated massively to the cloud and are sharing/reusing software and code to configure their environments.
GC communities of practices such as Open source software, Cloud and Agile host regular events for GC IT employees.

ESDC (especially IITB though it has influenced other branches as well) has seen a major shift towards Agile project management and automation.
ESDC has been a leader in OneGC Council and Clusters.
It's own digital transformation initiative is going well with BDM and the Service transformation going according to plan.

### IT within ESDC

IT is used as a strategic asset to improve services to citizens and is no longer seen as a "back-end" function.
ESDC service lines understand the cost and risks of using IT and have started to share its accountability by using a different governance and investment method as a means to reduce IT risks.
This means part of their budget is set to assure technical debt is exposed and handled in a timely manner.
IT fully understands its impact on ESDC's mandate and has heavily invested in learning, agility and automation as means to respond faster to business change.

The ESDC IT Strategy put in place a continuous improvement [transformation](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-culture-transform) based on the capabilities and recommendations from the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) and the annual [State of DevOps Report](https://cloud.google.com/devops/).
The goal has been to continuously increase frequency of delivery while reducing the lead time, the time to restore service when an incident occurs and the rate of failure.

The continuous improvement transformation is for all things that IT is responsible for.
This includes applications (software delivery, operations), infrastructure (user devices, services, networks).

#### Cultural

- https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-culture-learning-culture
- https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-culture-job-satisfaction
- https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-culture-westrum-organizational-culture

Employees feel that their work is meaningful and leverages their expertise.
They have the tools and resources necessary to get their work done.
These include technical resources, such as access to servers or environments necessary to develop and test, or resources needed to learn new skills.
Employees spend more time leveraging their creativity to add business value and less time on repetitive tasks.

Employees feel they can be honest with management without fear of reproach and be confident that things will improve.
Scope of changes are purposefully small, de-risking failures that enables learning as opposed to over analysing risks of non-compliance.
We learn from failure, hold blameless postmortems and continuously ask questions such as why did it fail?

Employees spend 20% of their time at work to focus on automation of current processes, prototyping related technologies or keeping up to date with trends and technologies, related to their work or the broader GC IT direction.
Said time also includes time for completing courses and attending conferences.
The budget for learning opportunities have increased every year for the past 5 years.

Employees attend presentations and events, which are held at least once a month by IT and provide opportunities and spaces for employees to learn and share their knowledge, such as a project they are working on or something they are investigating.
People who attend conferences or take courses then share their learnings via presentations or trip reports.
IT employees are encourage to complete online courses and form study groups as part of normal work activity.

Cooperation between IT and business has increased and there is a conscious effort to break down silos in IT and the wider organization.
Responsibility for building, deploying and maintaining systems, is shared by cross-functional teams that include representatives from each functional area of the software delivery process (business analysts, developers, quality engineers, operations, security, ..).

Overall employees working in IT at ESDC are happier, more productive and more up to date on technology, making them better able to support the needs of the department so that it can deliver more efficient services to Canadians.

#### Process

- https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-process-customer-feedback
- https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-process-work-visibility-in-value-stream
- https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-process-working-in-small-batches

Processes empower cross-functional teams and allow them to work on new ideas in pursuit of business goals that solve important problems.
Teams are provided with information and context letting them make informed decisions about the right work to do.
Information is open by default, reducing the burden on employees to request access to it.
Organizational outcomes are measured and provide information critical to making the best decisions.
Hackathons are held twice a year by IT.

Teams work using Agile methodologies to iterate on and continually improve solutions and services.
Clients are included from the start of projects and can submit regular feedback.
There is a big focus on automation of testing, deployments, security and service requests, removing the need for manual approvals.
Information about the flow of work across the whole value stream is readily available and teams have a good understanding of the flow of work from the business all the way through to citizens or ESDC employees.

Governance is moving to lean project management where desired outcomes are stated instead of requirements, and hypothesis are used instead of business cases, favouring smaller projects as a means to reduce risks and avoid feature bloat.
ESDC investment management enables this by allowing smaller, more iterative investments in IT.
Monitoring towards achievement of desired outcomes is used as project metrics as opposed to task completion.

Teams are able to provision an environment or device in an automated fashion, and know that any new environment or device reproduced from the same configuration is identical.
Production services can be restored repeatedly and predictably even when catastrophic events occur.

Source code, assets, configurations, or other documents part of a project's development and deployment are stored using a version control system that records changes to files.
Changes triggers automated tests and a build process that creates packages (executable, container, VM, ..) that can be deployed to any environment (testing or production) in an automated way.
Operations and infrastructure have moved towards automating as much as possible.
Builds are numbered, repeatable and are being run on demand by teams giving them quick feedback on their small batches of work.
Team members prioritize review of coworkers' changes to ensure that they don't have to wait days, to get merged and deployed.
The build statuses of projects are visible to the department.
Teams have access to adequate test data to run automated tests for projects.

Enterprise Architecture (EA) enables agility by empowering teams to choose tools and technologies, rapidly responding to new standards adoption, as well as providing light reference architectures.
EA enables ESDC to re-use investments via capability-base planning and influences where the department's investments needs to be allocated.
Technology stacks are periodically reviewed as part of team retrospectives (Agile), EA and security to critically evaluate how well the current tools address requirements.
New technologies are also proactively investigated and opportunities are provided to discuss and demonstrate new technologies for the standard technology stacks.

The security team is involved in the design phase for all projects and a security review is now a gating factor for releasing the design to the development stage.
Security tests are built into the automated testing process and can identify common security vulnerabilities.

#### Measurement

- https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-measurement-visual-management

IT teams use software that collects data throughout the value chain and aggregates it to serve different audiences.

Teams have established Work in progress (WIP) limits based on team capacity and workload assigned, in order to prioritize and focus on completing a small number of high-priority tasks.

IT teams provide proactive failure notifications, using key indicators and thresholds in monitoring software.
They get alerted before an application fails and pro-actively resolve issues before they impact users.
Following the diagnoses of incidents, indicators that could have predicted the incident are added to monitoring.

Mapping applications to business lines services, provides metrics on the overall health of the department's services to Canadians.
Business lines performance metrics are used as benchmark and the accountability of IT's impact to ESDC's mandate is shared.
