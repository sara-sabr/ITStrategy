The GC being one legal entity means that departments, agencies and other GC organizations should (must) share documents and collaborate widely to help each other.
GCxchange is a new platform available to all GC departments and agencies.
Through a one year pilot, the IT Strategy team at ESDC created a repository for [Software Assessments](https://gcxgce.sharepoint.com/teams/1000219) so that they can be shared across the GC.

## Problem Statement

GC departments are individually assessing and certifying their software assets.
This way of working leads to the following issues:

- **Duplication of Efforts** - the same software product is assessed more than once by different public servants
- **Scarcity of Labour** - the skillsets needed to complete an assessment (architecture, accessibility, security, and privacy domains) is not broadly available which can affect a department's ability to complete an assessment in a timely and quality fashion
- **Inconsistency**: an assessment from one department may be different than another one, causing confusion.
- **Employee Satisfaction** - It can be less motivating for assessors and their teams to work in isolation and make an impact only to a single department. Consequently, this leads to less learning opportunities
- **Users’ Security and Productivity** - Bugs/issues/workarounds and security vulnerabilities are only known by the department(s) who discovered it

## Opportunity and Expected Results

The pilot aims to reduce the workload required for software assessments across the GC by providing departments access to software assessment documents performed by other departments for information purposes as a starting point to their own processes.
It will also bring together the software assessment community in the GC and increase collaboration between departments.
Other impacts include:

- Less duplication and costs 
- Assessors can dedicate their time to high-value work 
- Higher quality of assessments 
- Higher employee satisfaction 
- Better security and productivity for end users 
- Reduced risks (by awareness of other departments using the same application) 
- Detailed audit trail (version control)
- Enhanced evidence-informed decision-making

### Align with Canada’s Digital Ambition

The [GC Digital Standards](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html) form the foundation of the government's shift to becoming more agile, open, and user-focused.
This pilot supports both the "Work in the open by default" and "Collaborate widely" Digital Standards.

The [Directive on Open Government](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=28108) also calls for "Maximizing the release of GC information".
In this case we are looking to maximize the internal release (between departments) of information.

Finnaly, [Canada's Digital Ambition 2022](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-operations-strategic-plans/canada-digital-ambition.html#toc4) defines digital for the GC as:

> The GC is an open and service-oriented organization that operates and delivers programs and services to people and businesses in simple, modern and effective ways that are optimized for digital and available anytime, anywhere and from any device.
> Digitally, the GC must **operate as one** to benefit the people of Canada.

Everything created by GC employees in all departments is Copyright (c) "His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the Minister" of that department.
Section 12 of the [Copyright Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/index.html) states that all works that are prepared by or under the direction or control of any government department falls under [Crown copyright](https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/crown-copyright-request.html#mm3).

Sharing documents created in one department for the benefit of the others should be the norm.

## GCxchange Group

GCxchange is an instance of Sharepoint/Teams making a good platform to create a shared document library and space to dicsuss software assessments in the GC.
The [Software Assessments GCexchange group](https://gcxgce.sharepoint.com/teams/1000219) is accessible to most of GC departments already.
GC Employees can see what documents have been shared and participate in discussions about software assessments.

Note: **Only Unclassified information can be shared on GCxchange** and that is the scope of documents to share as part of the pilot.

## Sharing ESDC Software Assessments
## Sharing Software Assessments - our journey and findings

This section highlight how ESDC is sharing software assessment and what concerns are currently being addressed to enable the sharing of those documents.

Before software can be used at ESDC, it must be assessed for architecture, accessibility, security and privacy.
The teams responsible for software assessments at ESDC agreed to participate in the pilot by sharing templates and the assessments they produce during the software intake process.
The concerns regarding sensitivity of some software assessments are being worked on with the respective teams in order to ensure only unclassified documents are being shared on GCExchange.

### Document Classification

Only the Security teams had most of their documents marked as Protected.
Everything else was assumed Unclassified but there are still debates around the classification of some assessments.
Highlighting the need to have better standards in place to enable information sharing.

The ESDC Regional Security Office (RSO) reviewed some sample assessment documents from architecture, accessibility and security, and found that they were Unclassified.
The RSO also reminded teams that classification of documents is still the responsibility of each team creating then.
 
### Legal Questions

As a starting position, the Government of Canada is one legal entity, hence sharing information between departments is generally not a problem.
However, in order to not prejudice future procurement processes we must confirm the following before sharing:

- The documents shared are for information purposes only - that is, to provide additional information for departments to consider when applying their own assessments for software usage;
- the information is shared only inside the GC; 
- the results of the shared audits do not disqualify a vendor from solicitation with other departments - that is, applying a blanket negative recommendation for all of GC would have important legal risks; and
- if a particular vendor has a highly restrictive NDA, confirm with legal.

Legal confirmed that there are no issues with ESDC sharing assessments, since this is internal to GC, for informational purposes only and it is not a blanket assessment for all GC departments to follow.
This applies wether the documents are Unclassified, Protected or Classified.
The diference would be the process to share these documents.

For the pilot, we are only looking to share Unclassified information, since that is what is curently supported on GCxchange.

### Fear of Being Embarrased

Through the pilot, some internal teams expressed concerns around usefulness of sharing information between departments, of fear of causing embarrassment, and questioning the document classification of those assessments as well as the legal aspects of sharing.

The pilot was able to demonstrate that other departments, especially smaller ones that do not have the same capacity as ESDC, were pleased to have ESDC's assessments shared, that no embarrassment occurred, and that only Unclassified documents were shared with the legal cover from ESDC's Legal Services.
Even with the limited number of assessments shared so far, the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive from the community.

## Feedback

When launching the GCxchange group, initial documents from architecture, accessibility and even a few from security were uploaded on the site.
Close to 100 GC employees joined after only a few posts on GCconnex, GCcollab, LinkedIn and Twitter.

The Open Government teams at TBS reached out to invite us to the Open Government Working Group to present the pilot.
The team working on the Data Strategy Renewal (also at TBS) offered to feature the pilot in a "vignette".

There were many comments that this is a very good idea, congratulating us on the initiave, hoping more departments got on board and forwarding this to there collegues.

Something that came up alot is that most departments don't have the same software assessment teams that ESDC has (architecture, accessibility, security and privacy), with diferent teams responsible for diferent parts of the assessments and intake process.
Usually all assessments will be done by small cross functionnal teams, that would really benefit from being able to refernece assessments done by larger departments with dedicated or specilized teams.

We also got many questions about specific software to see if others had assessed it and how its being used in other departments.
We tried to get the answers from the teams at ESDC or start the conversation on Teams on GCxchange.

Finally, one team wanted to know about the entire Software Intake Process at ESDC.
The process is currently being reviewed, but we still met with their Architecture/Cloud/Security team to discuss what they are doing do and share the documentation for our current process and governance.

## Next Steps

Dispite having confirmed that the GC is one legal entity and that software assessments are generally Unclassified, that will still be the biggest challenge to continue sharing and to get others to start sharing and [working in the open](https://sara-sabr.github.io/ITStrategy/2019/11/19/working-in-the-open-part-1.html).
The culture of silos and not wanting to show your work outside your team is a real fear that teams have.

The pilot aims to keep promoting collaboration between departments by sharing more software assessments from the ESDC teams and onboarding other departments to start sharing.
Getting some of the larger departments (CRA, DND, SSC, ..) to start sharing would be great for collaboration in the GC in general and would allow ESDC to continue to participate after the end of the pilot, since we would not be the only departments sharing documents.
