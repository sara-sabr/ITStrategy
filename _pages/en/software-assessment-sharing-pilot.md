Each GC department assesses their own software.
The pilot aims to reduce the workload required for software assessments across the GC by providing departments access to software assessment documents performed by other departments for information purposes as a starting point to their own processes.
It will also bring together the software assessment community in the GC and increase collaboration between departments. 

The GCexchange group is accessible to most of GC departments already.  Employees can see what documents have been shared and participate in discussions about software assessments. 
We need to spread the word to teams responsible for software assessments in other departments and onboard them to start sharing their assessment documents for this pilot and beyond. 

The idea of sharing software assessments between departments has been discussed many times on GCconnex over the years but was never formally put in place.  Some files were shared but they are not all easy to find or were only shared through email.
The IT Strategy team at ESDC put in place a document repository that can be accessed by all GC departments (that have onboarded to M365) using the new GCexchange platform.
This is a one-year pilot at ESDC and we plan to keep sharing our software assessments until August 2023.
Over 100 assessment documents have already been shared by ESDC Architecture, Accessibility and Security teams. 

## Problem Statement 

GC departments are individually assessing and certifying their software assets. This way of working leads to many issues: 
- **Duplication/Costs** – As the same software product is assessed multiple times
- **Scarcity of Labour** – IT specialists assessing these domains (architecture, accessibility, security…) exist in finite number across the government 
- **Lower Quality** – An assessment from only one specialist (or small team) is not as good as a wider review 
- **Employee Satisfaction** – It can be less motivating for assessors and their teams to work in isolation and make an impact only to a single department. Consequently, this leads to less learning opportunities 
- **Users’ Security and Productivity** – Bugs/issues/workarounds and security vulnerabilities are only known by the department(s) who discovered it

## Expected Results 

- Less duplication and costs 
- Assessors can dedicate their time to high-value work 
- Higher quality of assessments 
- Higher employee satisfaction 
- Better security and productivity for end users 
- Reduced risks (by awareness of other departments using the same application) 
- Detailed audit trail (version control)
- Greater public value from data
- Enhanced evidence-informed decision-making

### Align with Directive on Open Government and Digital Standards

- Maximizing the release of GC information
- Work in the open by default
- Collaborate widely

## Sharing ESDC Software Assessments

Before software can be used at ESDC, it must be assessed for security, accessibility, privacy and architecture.

Early on, the teams responsible for software assessments at ESDC (Architecture, Accessibility, Security and Privacy) agreed to share templates and the assessments they produce during the software intake process.
There were legitimate concerns about what we can and can't share and if these are really protected or classified information.

### Document Classification

The Regional Security Office (RSO) reviewed some sample assessment documents and found that they were Unclassified.
Of course, classification is still the responsibility of each team creating documents.
 
### Legal Questions

As a starting position, the Government of Canada is one legal entity, hence sharing information between departments is generally not a problem.
However, in order to not prejudice future procurement processes we must confirm the following before sharing:

- The documents shared are for information purposes only – that is, to provide additional information for departments to consider when applying their own assessments for software usage;
- the information is shared only inside the GC; 
- the results of the shared audits do not disqualify a vendor from solicitation with other departments – that is, applying a blanket negative recommendation for all of GC would have important legal risks; and
- if a particular vendor has a highly restrictive NDA, confirm with legal.

Legal confirmed that there are no issues with ESDC sharing assessments, since this is for informational purposes only and it is not a blanket assessment for all GC departments to follow.
