The idea of sharing software assessments documents and results between departments has been discussed many times on GCconnex over the years but was never formally put in place.
Some files were shared but they are not easy to find or were only shared through email.
GCxchange is a new platform available to all GC departments and agencies, that have onboarded to M365.
In time, it should replace GCconnex/GCmessage as the interdepartmental collaboration space for GC employees.
The IT Strategy team at ESDC put in place a document repository on GCxchange and confirmed that the GC is one legal entity, hence sharing software assessments between departments is not a problem.
This is a one-year pilot at ESDC and we plan to keep sharing our software assessments until August 2023.

## Problem Statement

GC departments are individually assessing and certifying their software assets.
This way of working leads to many issues, including:

- **Duplication/Costs** - As the same software product is assessed multiple times
- **Scarcity of Labour** - IT specialists assessing these domains (architecture, accessibility, security, privacy, ..) exist in finite number across the GC
- **Lower Quality** - An assessment from only one specialist (or small team) might not be as good as a wider review
- **Employee Satisfaction** - It can be less motivating for assessors and their teams to work in isolation and make an impact only to a single department. Consequently, this leads to less learning opportunities
- **Users’ Security and Productivity** - Bugs/issues/workarounds and security vulnerabilities are only known by the department(s) who discovered it

## Expected Results

The pilot aims to reduce the workload required for software assessments across the GC by providing departments access to software assessment documents performed by other departments for information purposes as a starting point to their own processes.
It will also bring together the software assessment community in the GC and increase collaboration between departments.
Other impacts include:

- Less duplication and costs 
- Assessors can dedicate their time to high-value work 
- Higher quality of assessments 
- Higher employee satisfaction 
- Better security and productivity for end users 
- Reduced risks (by awareness of other departments using the same application) 
- Detailed audit trail (version control)
- Greater public value from data
- Enhanced evidence-informed decision-making

### Align with Canada’s Digital Ambition

[Canada’s Digital Ambition 2022](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-operations-strategic-plans/canada-digital-ambition.html#toc4) defines digital Government as:

> The GC is an open and service-oriented organization that operates and delivers programs and services to people and businesses in simple, modern and effective ways that are optimized for digital and available anytime, anywhere and from any device.
> Digitally, the GC must **operate as one** to benefit the people of Canada.

The GC is already one organization in the legal sense.
Sharing documents created in one department for the benefit of the others should be the norm.

This direction is also reflected in the Directive on Open Government (Maximizing the release of GC information) and the GC Digital Standards (Work in the open by default and Collaborate widely).

## GCxchange Group

GCxchange is an instance of Sharepoint/Teams making a good platform to create a shared document library and space to dicsuss software assessments in the GC.
The GCexchange group is accessible to most of GC departments already.
GC Employees can see what documents have been shared and participate in discussions about software assessments.

Note: **Only Unclassified information can be shared on GCxchange** and that is what we want to share as part of the pilot.

## Sharing ESDC Software Assessments

Before software can be used at ESDC, it must be assessed for architecture, accessibility, security and privacy.
The teams responsible for software assessments at ESDC agreed to share templates and the assessments they produce during the software intake process.
There were legitimate concerns about what we can and can't share and if these are really protected or classified documents.

### Document Classification

Only the Security teams had most of their documents marked as Protected.
Everything else was assumed Unclassified but when asked to share the documents there was some worry that they could be Protected.

The Regional Security Office (RSO) reviewed some sample assessment documents from architecture, accessibility and security, and found that they were Unclassified.
The RSO also reminded teams that classification of documents is still the responsibility of each team creating then.
 
### Legal Questions

As a starting position, the Government of Canada is one legal entity, hence sharing information between departments is generally not a problem.
However, in order to not prejudice future procurement processes we must confirm the following before sharing:

- The documents shared are for information purposes only - that is, to provide additional information for departments to consider when applying their own assessments for software usage;
- the information is shared only inside the GC; 
- the results of the shared audits do not disqualify a vendor from solicitation with other departments - that is, applying a blanket negative recommendation for all of GC would have important legal risks; and
- if a particular vendor has a highly restrictive NDA, confirm with legal.

Legal confirmed that there are no issues with ESDC sharing assessments, since this is for informational purposes only and it is not a blanket assessment for all GC departments to follow.
This applies wether the documents are Unclassified, Protected or Classified.
The diference would be the process to share these documents.

For the pilot, we are only looking to share Unclassified information, since that is what is curently supported on GCxchange.

### Fear of Being Embarrased

More than one team claimed that sharing the documents they produce would not be useful to other departments.
Some went as far as saying that they are worried that it would be embarrassing for them and the department to share this files.
This is where they would usualy go back to questions about Legal or document classification.

What we noticed, was the exact oposite of that.
Smaller departments are happy to see ESDC (one of the largest departments in the GC) start sharing software assessment documents and event with the limited number (and sometimes low quality) of assessments shared so far, the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive from the community.

## Feedback

When launching the GCxchange group, initial documents from architecture, accessibility and even a few from security were uploaded on the site.
Close to 100 GC employees joined after only a few posts on GCconnex, GCcollab, LinkedIn and Twitter.

The Open Government teams at TBS reached out to invite us to the Open Government Working Group to present the pilot.
The team working on the Data Strategy Renewal (also at TBS) offered to feature the pilot in a "vignette".

There were many comments that this is a very good idea, congratulating us on the initiave, hoping more departments got on board and forwarding this to there collegues.

Something that came up alot is that most departments don't have the same software assessment teams that ESDC has (architecture, accessibility, security and privacy), with diferent teams responsible for diferent parts of the assessments and intake process.
Usually all assessments will be done by small cross functionnal teams, that would really benefit from being able to refernece assessments done by larger departments with dedicated or specilized teams.

We also got many questions about specific software to see if others had assessed it and how its being used in other departments.
We tried to get the answers from the teams at ESDC or start the conversation on Teams on GCxchange.

Finally, one team wanted to know about the entire Software Intake Process at ESDC.
The process is currently being reviewed, but we still met with their Architecture/Cloud/Security team to discuss what they are doing do and share the documentation for our current process and governance.

## Next Steps

Dispite having confirmed that the GC is one legal entity and that software assessments are generally Unclassified, that will still be the biggest challenge to continue sharing and to get others to start sharing and [working in the open](https://sara-sabr.github.io/ITStrategy/2019/11/19/working-in-the-open-part-1.html).
The culture of silos and not wanting to show your work outside your team is a real fear that teams have.

The pilot aims to keep promoting collaboration between departments by sharing more software assessments from the ESDC teams and onboarding other departments to start sharing.
Getting some of the larger departments (CRA, DND, SSC, ..) to start sharing would be great for collaboration in the GC in general and would allow ESDC to continue to participate after the end of the pilot, since we would not be the only departments sharing documents.
