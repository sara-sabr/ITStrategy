### Continuous Improvement Transformation

<img src="assets/images/AssessmentTool1.png" alt="This image shows how to improve team transformation. There are five stages of improvement: 1. Setting goals - where IITB sets aspirational goal. 2. Current condition - where teams seek to understand the current condition. 3. Measurable targets - where teams set measurable targets for a future date. 4. Running experiments -where teams run experiments on a daily basis to move towards the target conditions, using PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act) method. 5. New targets - where teams capture, set new targets and going to repat the process 2-3 times. The image also demonstrates PDCA method. Plan - determine the expected outcome. Do - perform the experiment. Check- study the results. Act - decide what to do next.">

### Running experiments

#### Ask the following questions

- What are the current and target conditions?
- What obstacles do you think are preventing you from reaching the target condition?
- Which one are you addressing now?
- What is your next step? What outcomes do you expect?
- When can the results be evaluated to see what can be learned from taking that step?

## How does it work?

Survey with 11 sections

Teams are encouraged to fill out every section, but it is possible to fill out individual sections independently.

--

<img src="assets/images/Process.png" alt= "First, IT teams receive a link to take advantage of the DevOps Self-Assessment tool (example: IT Strategy website, email, coworker sharing. Then, the user is taking a survey after what it is scored based on responces. If the user scores high, which is 90-100%, the team is doing well. If the user scores medium, which is 50-89%, there is a room for the team to improve. If the user score low, which is 0-49%, the team needs to fill gaps with new learning opportunities. In all cases recommendations on where and how to improve will be provided. Finally, the user can save results.">
