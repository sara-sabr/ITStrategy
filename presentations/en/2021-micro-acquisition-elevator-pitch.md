# Micro-Acquisition Pilot

ESDC IT Strategy Team

Note:

- we are here today to talk to you about our procurement pilot and we will
- but first we want to talk a little about what we believe as these beliefs are what are driving this pilot

---

Continuously improving systems and processes while also keeping the lights on is hard

Note:

- productivity dip initially while learning
- Every department is currently struggling with tech debt

---

Learning new things is essential to keep up with the fast pace of IT

Note:

- and so learning often takes  a back seat
- But that's a problem because for us CS's (soon to be ITs) its important for us to keep up with the fast pace of IT.
- The only constant with IT is change.
- We are interested in teh different ways of learning - not just from taking a course, but from reverse engineering someone else's code.
(and we know that learning often takes a back seat to operational activities)

Sharing ideas, solutions and code across teams, branches and departments can free up valuable time

Note:

- reduce duplication - lets not do the same thing. Sharing our work... (add something here from open gov?)
- participate in a community - you already have some approval to do this - It's part of the Public Service's Value and Ethics, ESDC's Code of Conduct, Directive on Open Government, Direction on enabling open access to web services, Directive on Service and Digital examples of acceptable network and device use, ESDC Network Use Directive.
- OSS code is more secure
- e.g. influencers network

IT contract dollars going to the same usual suspects reduces our exposure to new ideas

Note:

- We know who these usual suspects are....there are teh big players who win the multi-million dollar contracts and the small local players in the NCR who we see regularly on the smaller contracts.
- Nothing against any of these companies.
- But we believe the more variety and diversity of suppliers leads to a great variety and diversity of ideas.

There is a vast amount of IT talent out there for whom a $10K contract would mean a whole lot

Note:

- for example University students, single parents needing extra income, small scale freelancers
- Maybe folks who are now unemployed or under employed due to covid.
- ESDC's mandate of employment drives us in wanting to get GC contract dollars in the hands of these folks.

**add image of lightbulb**
Fix everything with procurement!

Note:

- joking. This is a complex problem with multiple solutions contribution to moving us forward.
- Outsourcing large IT solutions has a problematic track record
- We are not pro-outsourcing all things.
- Phoenix, canada.ca email examples of outsourcing gone wrong for many reasons
- but we believe there is a strong benefit to outsourcing when keeping the lights on means that issues remain stuck in the backlog, or when having no time to learn new skills prevents moving towards modern approaches.
- procurement could be one piece of the puzzle.
- what if outsourcing small things could give you the breathing room to learn or bypass the productivity dip of making a change.

Scope of the Micro-Acquisition pilot

- procurement of custom unclassified code
- licenced as open source
- <$10K
- no security clearance required
- work done in the open
- paid by credit card

Note:

- so we want to introduce you to the micro-acquisition pilot
- this is a procurement option developed in partnership between IITB and CFOB
- through this option you can procure custom unlassified code (think automation scripts, accessibility and bug fixes, small add/on modules, data analysis). The code that is delivered must be licenced as open source and the total value of the contract must be less than $10K including taxes. The work is all done on open repositories
- suppliers face reduced barriers because they do not require a security clearance and qualification does not require business income in the millions nor proof of work of other contracts

We are reducing risk through:

- code acceptance criteria
- taking lessons from others who have done this
- partnership with CFOB

Note:

- before we finish i want to talk briefly about how we are reducing risk
- opportunity statement must include the tests we will be doing on the code to ensure it meets functional requirements as well as quality and security requirements
- can't overstate the importance of having CFOB (in particular the procurement innovation team) as our partners in this. simply put they made all the key pieces happen like getting the legal framework in place as well as the payment by credit card. We are so glad to be working on this with them.
