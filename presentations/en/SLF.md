## 1. IT Strategy Team's Mandate

--

### Context

- The upcoming Policy on Service and Digital calls for a digitally enabled government which delivers services through technology <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Demands for organizational technological competence will only increase going forward <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Business agility depends on technology agility <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- The use of technology is costly and risky <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
- ESDC can no longer see technological problems as "just an IT problem <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->"

Note:
[Decembre 2018 presentation at Senior Leadership Meeting on IM/IT](http://dialogue/grp/BU6810070/Shared%20Documents/Reference%20Materials/ESDC%20IMIT%20Moving%20Forward%20(DM%20Meeting).pptx) had a problem statement regarding the emergence of digital government through new business, policy, and technology direction and that ESDC must change the manner in which IT services are delivered.

Here is our team's perspective on this problem...

Evidence of this is how ESDC's CRP identifies IT as its #1 risk
IT is no longer a back office function

--

The use of technology to deliver a mandate ***must*** be a shared accountability

Note:

- On one side IITB must significanly improve its responsiveness to change to share accountability for ESDC service performance
- On the other LOBs must understand the costs and risks of using IT to deliver their services

--

This changes the Business-IT relationship from a ***contracting model one***** to a **partnership one**

Note:

- Contracting model: requirements-based, a company within a company
- Partnership model: outcome-based, one team - we're in this together

--

### IT Strategy team's mission

Enable the strategic value of IT within ESDC by ***reducing its risks*** and ***increasing business agility***

Note:
Mission = reasons to exist
We argue the very point of TRANSFORMATION in Digital Transformation is to reduce risk.
Quote from ex-CIO of USCIS and now Enterprise Strategist at AWS
> To work effectively in the digital world, you must first accept complexity and uncertainty, for they demand very different approach to carrying out initiatives. A predictable world rewards advanced planning and rigid plan execution. But a complex and uncertain world rewards an empirical cycle of trying, observing, and correcting

We argue that the convential methods of doing IT does *not* reduce risks. It *promotes* it.

--

### Mandate (authority)

--

#### 1. Diagnose

***Diagnose key problems:***

- Organizational problems
- Waste
- Impediments to rapid lead times, and
- Governance structures

The aforementioned items inhibit the desired changes in behaviours required for a digital-first government

Note:
Organizational debt = we adopt new ways of doing things without retiring the old ones.
Mention US Defence publishing a paper on "Detecting Agile BS": we are structured in a way that inhibits us to be agile. E.g. inability to release to production.

--

#### 2. Recommend

Recommend ***specific course of actions*** to governance bodies to adopt new methods of managing IT risks

--

#### 3. Measure

***Measure progress of adoption*** of strategies in IT teams and governance bodies as a ***performance indicator*** of the IT Strategy team

Note:
The DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA, a research group that seeks to understand practices that lead to excellence in technology delivery) groups the 21 DevOps capabilities under 4 pillars, one of which is measurement.

--

#### 4. Challenge

Challenge ***current*** thinking and approaches

Note:

- Why are you sending me a softcopy of a word document by email? Why not grant me access to your sharepoint site?
- Why do you seek approval for something you have accountability for?
- Show me the policy statement that says I can't do X. Until you do I am doing X

--

### Team's guiding principles

--

#### 1. Work collaboratively

Note:
Collaborate with anyone and everyone who can add value. This includes, but is not limited to, all Canadians, levels of government, departments, private sector organizations, and governments.

Another reason we put our draft work on Github: discovery and shareability.

--

#### 2. Continuous learning

Note:
Learning is a core part of daily activities to ensure up to date, modern, and well-researched direction.

--

#### 3. Lead by Example

Note:
By using the approaches and technologies we champion, we are able to better respond and anticipate potential challenges. We also experiment with modern ways of working in order to demonstrate their value and effectiveness.

E.g. hosting online while applying security, privacy, and quality controls (2 factor, automated testing) and due diligence (no names or materials that are protected)

---

## 2. Team's area of focus

--

### Core Competencies

- Empower IT teams
- Based on the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) capabilities

Note:
DORA is six years of research and data from over 31k professionals worldwide.
Results let us understand the practices that lead to excellence in technology delivery
Industry-standard Four Key Metrics (lead time, deployment frequency, Time to Restore, and change fail %)

DORA stats on Elite performers:

- 208 times more frequent code deployments
- 106 times faster lead time from commit to deploy
- 2,604 times faster to recover from incidents
- 7 times lower change failure rate

--

DevOps capabilities

1. Cultural (3)
2. Process (5)
3. Technical (9)
4. Measurement (4)

Note:
Cultural e.g.: job satisfaction, westerum org culture (high trust and emphasize info flow), learning culture
Process e.g.: experimentation, change approval, feedback, visibility of work (flow), small batches
Technical e.g.: version control, CI, Test automation, Architecture, empowering teams to choose tools, shift left on security
Measurement e.g.: monitoring, proactive failure notification, WIP limits, visual mgt (e.g.kanban)

--

### Moving to Product Management

- From ***Project & Cost Centres*** to ***Product Value Streams***
- From ***Siloes & Proxy Metrics*** to ***Flow Metrics & Business Results***
- From ***Fragmented Value Streams*** to ***Integrated Value Stream Network***

Note:

- Impacts financial management
- Impacts business owners (less about requirements, more about outcomes) - they are part of the product team
- Impacts our functional matrix
- Requires relentless automation (deploy to production)

--

### Establish strategic partnership with SSPB

Raise awareness of the changes the new Policy on Service and Digital has to ESDC's service delivery
