## 1. Approach to IT Strategy

### Purpose

2018-12 - IT strategy team was created with goal of getting an integrated business-IT strategy

> But, we are not doing conventional IT strategy

Note:

Provide examples..
Talk about premise: the relationship between business and IT _must_ change to a shared accountability model, as the conventional contracting model (requirements based, a company within a company) of business-IT does deliver the intended results in a digital age. We should instead move to a partnership based approach (outcomes based, one team). The future is too unpredictable and complex so the conventional long term planning do not deliver the intended results. Therefore, we must instead reward an empirical cycle of trying, observing, and correcting.

--

#### How we are **NOT** doing this

We instead will focus on IT's ability to quickly respond to business changes

--

#### How we are **doing** this

In the open. All are welcome and invited to comment and contribute to the strategies at all times -- as far customers, private sector partners, other levels of government, or other departments.

Quote of Mark Schwartz

> To work effectively in the digital world, you must first accept complexity and uncertainty, for they demand very different approach to carrying out initiatives. A predictable world rewards advanced planning and rigid plan execution. But a complex and uncertain world rewards an empirical cycle of trying, observing, and correcting.

---

### Approach

#### Mandate

Enable the strategic value of IT within ESDC by reducing its risks and increasing business agility.

--

#### Diagnose and recommend changes

> Problems that inhibit the desired changes in behaviours

- Examples
  - Heavy Governance promotes risks, need to reduce burden of giving permission to work
  - Senior Advisors release process mapping involving 13 different teams and up to 49 email exchanges, need for embedded teams

--

#### Measuring progress

> Making course correction from emperical evidence

--

#### Challenge current thinking and approaches

- Examples
  - No more status update meetings due to modern tools (KANBAN boards in the open)
  - This presentation not working in IE and refusal to make it work in IE because we're focusing on modern tech
  - Technical work needing to be reviewed by non technical staff for approval
  - Defaults over standards (if an expert in their respective area proposes a different approach than the departmental 'default' they are free to do so -- perhaps that will become the next default)

---

### 2. Focused Areas

- Moving to Product Management
  - Raising awareness on inadequate funding model for the Digital World
  - Moving to embedded and dedicated product teams
  - Ability to deploy and manage production workloads
  - Lessons learned from failed attempts (e.g. PSPC)
- 21 DevOps capabilities (DORA), including job satisfaction
- Adoption of Open Source, as a philosophy
- Empowering employees
- Automation to allow staff to focus on meaningful work
