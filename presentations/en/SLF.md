## 1. Approach to IT Strategy

### Purpose

Dec. 2018 - The need for an IT Strategy identified with goal of producing an integrated Business-IT Strategy

> But, we are not doing conventional IT strategy

Note:

Conventional IT = predicting what business will want and planning ahead of time

--

#### How we are **NOT** doing this

We instead focus on IT's ability to quickly respond to business changes

> To work effectively in the digital world, you must first accept complexity and uncertainty, for they demand very different approach to carrying out initiatives. A predictable world rewards advanced planning and rigid plan execution. But a complex and uncertain world rewards an empirical cycle of trying, observing, and correcting.

- Mark Schwartz

Note:

- Premise: The future is too unpredictable and complex. It warrants an empirical cycle of trying, observing, and correcting over advanced planning and rigid plan execution
- the relationship between business and IT _must_ change to a shared accountability model
- conventional contracting model (requirements based, a company within a company) to a partnership one (outcomes based, one team solving problems)

--

#### How we are **doing** this

In the Open. All are welcome and invited to comment and contribute to the strategies at all times

Customers, private sector partners, other levels of government, or other departments...

---

### Approach

#### Mandate

Enable the strategic value of IT within ESDC by reducing its risks and increasing business agility

--

#### Diagnose and recommend changes

> Problems that inhibit the desired changes in behaviours

E.g.

1. CFOB's Policy on Project and Program  Management (PPPM)
2. AppDev Senior Advisors Release Process

Note:

- 2 examples
- PMLC from CFOB: small IT Project requires 21 and 34 PM artefacts, 48 and 54 PM activities, and involving min 16 stakeholders.
- SA's Release Process: 13 separate teams and up to 45 interactions. Sources of waste, error, dilutes empathy towards end user, affects employee moral (DORA research)

--

#### Measuring progress

> Making course correction from emperical evidence

--

#### Challenge current thinking and approaches

<section style="text-align: left;">
Examples
</section>

- No more status update meetings, transition to modern tools (e.g. Kanban boards in the open)
- This Web-based presentation doesn't work in IE - because of use of modern tech
- Technical work needing to be reviewed by non technical staff for approval
- Defaults over Standards

Note:

If an expert in their respective area proposes a different approach than the departmental 'default' they are free to do so -- perhaps that will become the next default.

---

### 2. Focused Areas
