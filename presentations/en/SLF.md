## Background

[Decembre 2018 presentation at Senior Leadership Meeting on IM/IT](http://dialogue/grp/BU6810070/Shared%20Documents/Reference%20Materials/ESDC%20IMIT%20Moving%20Forward%20(DM%20Meeting).pptx) set the stage for the IITB Way Forward plan and the need for an IT Strategy. It highlighted:

- IITB has 41 IM/IT services and key functions
- IITB has 33 service objectives
- ESDC is not currently equipped or organized to handle upcoming changes well

Note:
The presentation established an ESDC IM/IT Vision and areas where service improvement, modernization, and/or investment are required
It provided a SWOT analysis of the organization based on Gartner's IITB Service Maturity assessment

> GC has never undertaken an IT-enabled business transformation undertaking of this magnitude (BDM)

Note:
This statement was followed by 6 migitation approaches to "ensure that benefits to Canadians are never at risk"

1. Managed by Program Sponsor ensures single accountability for all elements of project delivery  
2. Single project team, with dedicated integrated IT team, promotes stronger engagement and improves timely decision-making  
3. Multiple system integrators, managed by the government, working together towards a single business objective  
4. Multiple new technologies, including use of SaaS Solutions  and commercial cloud services  
5. Parallel operational environment to ensure correct delivery of programs to citizens  
6. Interconnect new system with legacy system for production services  

--

As a response, senior leaders highlighted 4 areas of work:

- 4 areas that listed 26 activities (the IITB Way Forward)
- 1 area about *Strategy*

Note:

- Highlight the 3 End State Vision statemnets
- Highlight the 4 questions being asked

## The IT Strategy team's perspective

- The new Policy on Service and Digital calls for a digitally enabled government which delivers services through technology
- Demands for organizational technological competence will only increase going forward
- Business agility depends on technology agility
- The use of technology is costly and risky (#1 corporate risk)
- ESDC can no longer see technological problems as "just an IT problem"

*The use of technology to deliver a mandate ***must*** be a shared accountability*

Note:
This slide is about our perspective to the problem statement of IT
ESDC corporate risk profile identifies IT as the #1 risk to the organization
"The very point of digital transformation is to reduce risk" - War & Peace & IT

---

## IT Strategy team's mission

(Reason for existence)

Enable the strategic value of IT within ESDC by ***reducing its risks*** and ***increasing business agility***.

Note:
It is *NOT* about predicting the future
It is about empowering teams to be more agile

## Mandate (authority)

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
1. Diagnose key problems
  * organizational problems
  * waste
  * impediments to rapid lead times, and
  * governance structures
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

The aforementioned items inhibit the desired changes in behaviours required
 for a digital-first government

## Team's guiding principles
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

--

Work collaboratively
Note:
Collaborate with anyone and everyone who can add value. This includes, but is not limited to, all Canadians, levels of government, departments, private sector organizations, and governments.

--

Continuous learning
Note:
Learning is a core part of daily activities to ensure up to date, modern, and well-researched direction.

--

Lead by Example
Note:
By using the approaches and technologies we champion, we are able to better respond and anticipate potential challenges. We also experiment with modern ways of working in order to demonstrate their value and effectiveness.

## Team's area of focus

### Core Competencies

Based on the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) capabilities

Note:
DORA is six years of research and data from over 31k professionals worldwide
Largest and longest-running research of its kind
Results let us understand the practices that lead to excellence in technology delivery and powerful business outcomes
Industry-standard Four Key Metrics (lead time, deployment frequency, MTTR, and change fil percentage)

DORA stats on Elite performers:

- 208 times more frequent code delpoyments
- 106 times faster lead time from commit to deploy
- 2,604 times faster to recover from incidents
- 7 times lower change failure rate

--

DevOps capabilities

1. Cultural (3)
2. Process (5)
3. Technical (9)
4. Measurement (4)

Note:
Cultural e.g.: job satisfaction, westerum org culture (high trust and emphasize info flow), learning culture
Process e.g.: experimentation, change approval, feedback, visibility of work (flow), small batches
Technical e.g.: version control, CI, Test automation, Architecture, empowering teams to choose tools, shift left on security
Measurement e.g.: monitoring, proactive failure notification, WIP limits, visual mgt (e.g.kanban)

## Immediate Actions

### Alignh with GC IT Direction

- [Digital Standards](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html)
- [Digital Operations Strategic Plan (2018-2022) - OneGC Vision](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-operations-strategic-plan-2018-2022.html)
- [Policy](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32603) and [Directive on Service and Digital](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32601)

- [Acceptable Network and Device Use](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32605)

### Cultural

- Provide psychological safety (safe environments for experimentation and blameless postmortems)
- Promote CoPs supported by PoCs instead of CoEs
- Make information easy to search and find :
  - GIT-based version control system
  - open by default sharepoint sites
- 20% of your time to learn/try new technologies, stay up to date, and automate a manual process
- IT teams must have access to modern tooling, such as SaaS (Internet), mobile, and desktop tools
- Hire favouring candidates who demonstrate adaptability, curiosity, and strong ethics

Note:
(from DORA DevOps 2019 Report) In general, CoEs are not recommended because they centralize expertise in one group
Common pitfalls in job satisfaction: Not giving people the tools they need to be successful, not giving people meaningful work

### Process

- remove manual/committee approval where possible
- empower teams to work on new ideas in pursuit of business goals that solve important problems
- engage clients early and seek regular feedback
- avoid toil, invest in relentless process automation
- promote smaller investments based on business outcomes, not project tasts
- Use Agile methodologies, iterate and continually improve solutions and services

Note:
Toil is introduced when the approach to increasing efficiency is linear with respect to the amount of resources required.
Toil, for example, would be increased hiring for repetitive, automatable, work that would better be solved by time investment in automation

### Technical

- Automate everything (builds, tests, deployment, security, change approvals)
- Save all project artifacts to a git-based version control system
- Have access to realistic test data
- Actively and fairly consider open standards and open source software
- Loosely couple architectures
- Allow IT teams chose their own tools
- Shift left on security by adopting a security by design approach
- Invest in code maintainability

Note:
Example: play-with-docker available for free to learn about containers, but websockets blocked

### Measurement

- collect data throughout the value stream
- establish Work in Progress (WIP) limits
- make collected data and project status visible to the business
