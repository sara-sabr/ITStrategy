## 1. IT Strategy approach

Purpose: Set the stage by clearly communicate that we are not doing conventional IT strategy with some examples of what that means

Talk about:

- Genesis of IT strategy and reason why the team got created (Dec 2018 senior leader meeting, goal of getting an integrated business-IT strategy)
- How we are **NOT** doing this
  - We instead will focus on IT's ability to quickly respond to business changes
- How are **are** doing this
  - In the open. All are welcome and invited to comment and contribute to the strategies at all times -- as far customers, private sector partners, other levels of government, or other departments.
- Talk about premise: the relationship between business and IT *must* change to a shared accountability model, as the conventional contracting model (requirements based, a company within a company) of business-IT does deliver the intended results in a digital age. We should instead move to a partnership based approach (outcomes based, one team). The future is too unpredictable and complex so the conventional long term planning do not deliver the intended results. Therefore, we must instead reward an empirical cycle of trying, observing, and correcting.

Quote of Mark Schwartz
> To work effectively in the digital world, you must first accept complexity and uncertainty, for they demand very different approach to carrying out initiatives. A predictable world rewards advanced planning and rigid plan execution. But a complex and uncertain world rewards an empirical cycle of trying, observing, and correcting.

Talk about 4 angles the team is addressing using strategies (mandate)

- Diagnose and Recommend changes on problems that inhibit the desired changes in behaviours
  - example: Heavy Governance promotes risks, need to reduce burden of giving permission to work
  - example: Senior Advisors release process mapping involving 13 different teams and up to 49 email exchanges, need for embedded teams
- Measuring strategy progress using non-invasive means and making course correction from emperical evidence
- Challenge current thinking and approaches
  - example: No more status update meetings due to modern tools (KANBAN boards in the open)
  - example: This presentation not working in IE and refusal to make it work in IE because we're focusing on modern tech
  - example: Technical work needing to be reviewed by non technical staff for approval
  - example: Defaults over standards (if an expert in their respective area proposes a different approach than the departmental 'default' they are free to do so -- perhaps that will become the next default)
