### Our Mandate: helping you navigate through change

![Mandate: helping you navigate through change](./assets/images/slf-presentation-mandate.png)

Note:

- We want to enable IT to rapidly respond to changes
- We do this by reducing risks and enabling untapped strategic value of technology
- The idea here is accepting complexity and finding new methods of managing IT investements
- E.g. reduce project sizes, improve information flow between teams, make it less onerous to approve change, use emperical evidence to inform decisions
- E.g. of problems identified: AppDev SAs release process needing 13 separate teams and up to 46 interactions

### Our Approach

<img src="assets/images/slf-presentation-approach.png" alt="Approach: Diagnose, Recommend, Measure, Enable New Ways" height="85%" width="85%">

Note:

1. Diagnose
   - Work transparently with our users
   - clearly identify problems
   - Research best practices
2. Recommendations
   - Enabling new ways of thinking
   - Strategies and actions that work for both the working level and management
3. Measuring Progress
   - Progress with metrics, non-invasive
   - use emperical evidence to course correct
4. Improvement
   - Enabling new ways of working and ensuring we retire the old ones (Organizational Debt)
