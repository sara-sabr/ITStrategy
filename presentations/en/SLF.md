# Senior Leadership Forum

ESDC IT Strategy (30 min presentation)

2020-01-29

---

## Agenda

1. Nonconventional approach to IT Strategy
2. Focus Areas
3. Strategies and Actions

---

## 1. Approach to IT Strategy

### Context

- Identification of need for an IT Strategy team: Dec. 2018 (inception of IITB Way Forward)
- Expectation of an _single integrated business and IT strategy, founded on a common and clear enterprise architecture, in alignment with GC priorities_

> IT Strategy team at 2019 CIOC: we are **not** doing this

Note:

- Dec 2018: Senior Leaders of IM/IT To discuss the evolution and maturation of ESDCâ€™s IM/IT service delivery supporting programs, departmental systems, and employees
- Problem Statement: changes will have a fundamental impact on how IM/IT services are delivered in support of ESDC programs
- Conventional IT = predicting what business will want and planning ahead of time
- JOKE: we know it sounds presumptious

--

### What we are doing instead

Focus on IT's ability to quickly respond to business changes

> To work effectively in the digital world, you must first accept complexity and uncertainty, for they demand very different approach to carrying out initiatives. A predictable world rewards advanced planning and rigid plan execution. But a complex and uncertain world rewards an empirical cycle of trying, observing, and correcting.

- Mark Schwartz

Note:

- Premise: The future is too unpredictable and complex. New style of managing initiatives
- Digital: IT is not longer a back-office function
- The relationship between business and IT _must_ change to a shared accountability model
- Conventional contracting model (requirements based, a company within a company) to a partnership one (outcomes based, one team solving problems)
- This means Business MUST share the costs and risks of using technology
- This means IT MUST be able to change as fast as business

--

### Mandate

Enable the strategic value of IT within ESDC by reducing its risks and increasing business agility

Note:

- Speed is how we can reduce risks
- But we are not setup for speed

--

### How we are **doing** strategy making

In the Open. All are welcome and invited to comment and contribute to the strategies at all times

Customers, private sector partners, other levels of government, or other departments...

Note:

- We purposefully put our content on the internet so that it is discoverable and shareable outside ESDC

--

### Diagnose and recommend changes

> Problems that inhibit the desired changes in behaviours

E.g.

1. CFOB's Policy on Project and Program  Management (PPPM)
2. AppDev Senior Advisors Release Process

Note:

- 2 examples
- PMLC from CFOB: small IT Project requires 21 and 34 PM artefacts, 48 and 54 PM activities, and involving min 16 stakeholders.
- SA's Release Process: 13 separate teams and up to 45 interactions. Sources of waste, error, dilutes empathy towards end user, affects employee moral (DORA research)
- Work already happening within IITB PMO, SAs, and other product teams to reduce time to production (DTS, Interop)

--

### Measuring progress

> Making course correction from emperical evidence

Note:

- Using non-invasing data collection methods
- Humility: treat strategy as a hypothesis that needs validation

--

### Challenge current thinking and approaches

To reduce organizational debt

E.g.

- Exposed work in progress via Kanban boards = No more status update meetings
- Modern solutions from the industry needing modern clients
- Technical work needing to be reviewed by non technical staff for approval
- Defaults over Standards

Note:

- JOKE: we know it sounds even MORE presumptious
- Organizational debt = expecting new methods of doing things by modern tool adoption but not retiring the old ways of doing things
- Modern clients: this Web-based presentation doesn't work in IE. We could make it work because OSS. But that defeats the purpose
- Default: If an expert in their respective area proposes a different approach than the departmental 'default' they are free to do so -- perhaps that will become the next default.

---

## 2. Focused Areas

- Moving to Product Management
- 21 DevOps capabilities (DORA), including job satisfaction
- Adoption of Open Source, as a philosophy
- Empowering employees
- Identify and address toil to allow staff to focus on meaningful work
- Enable IITB teams to design for users with users, iterate and improve frequently

Link to [Strategy Map](strategy-summary.html)

Note:

- Product Management: affects funding model, team composition, automatic deployment, lessons learned
- DORA: Institude that studies high performing technology organization
- Enabling IITB: focus on client-centric service design and delivery, an approach that focuses on addressing client or user expectations, needs, challenges, and feedback. We  need to talk to the user to know their needs and expectations. Get feedback, identify user needs, come up with design ideas
- IT Strategy team will start engaging with IITB teams soon to get their feedback, as users, on what needs to happen to get there

---

## 3. Strategies and actions

- Starting in the new fiscal year, IT Strategy will propose tangible quarterly actions to be integrated into daily work
- During each quarter, IT Strategy will list their actions for the quarter, and advise actions the Branch should take

--

### Goals

- Continuously learn and improve
- Reduce lead time for changes and delivery of services/devices
- Recover faster incidents and errors
- Reduce frequency of incidents and errors
- Align with GC IT Direction

--

### Q1 (2020-04) strategies and actions

> **Use 20% of time to Learn and Improve**

- Use CATS codes for continuous improvement
- Gather metrics (ex.: start and end date) for things your team works on
