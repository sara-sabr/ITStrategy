### How are you handling those changes right now?

1. How often, per month, do your priorities change?
2. How often do you have to revisit your project estimates?
3. How many of your commitments depend on another team's ability to deliver?

Note:

- Ask 3 questions to the audience to get their impression
- Hypothesis of results in line with Public Service Employee Survey for ESDC CS category. Source: https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pses-saff/2019/results-resultats/bq-pq/02/dem9424-eng.aspx
- In particular following questions:
  - Q17. I can complete my assigned workload during my regular working hours: CS5 = 33% rarely or almost never
  - Q18a. I feel that the quality of my work suffers because of... constantly changing priorities: CS4 = 48%, CS5 = 40% always or often
  - Q18d. I feel that the quality of my work suffers because of... unreasonable deadlines" CS4 = 38%, CS5 = 48% always or often
  - Q40. I feel that change is managed well in my department or agency: CS4 = 28%, CS5 = 26% somewhat or strongly disagree
  - Q74b. Overall, to what extent do the following factors cause you stress at work? Heavy workload, CS4 = 41$, CS5 = 52% large or very large extent
  - Q74c. Overall, to what extent do the following factors cause you stress at work? Unreasonable deadlines, CS4 = 27%, CS5 = 39% large or very large extent

### Our Mandate: helping you navigate through change

![Mandate: helping you navigate through change](./assets/images/slf-presentation-mandate.png)

Note:

- We want to enable IT to rapidly respond to changes
- We do this by reducing risks and enabling untapped strategic value of technology
- The idea here is accepting complexity and finding new methods of managing IT investements
- E.g. reduce project sizes, improve information flow between teams, make it less onerous to approve change, use emperical evidence to inform decisions
- E.g. of problems identified: AppDev SAs release process needing 13 separate teams and up to 46 interactions

---

### Our Approach

![Approach: Diagnose, Recommend, Measure, Enable New Ways](./assets/images/slf-presentation-approach.png)

Note:

1. Diagnose
   - Work transparently with our users
   - clearly identify problems
   - Research best practices
2. Recommendations
   - Enabling new ways of thinking
   - Strategies and actions that work for both the working level and management
3. Measuring Progress
   - Progress with metrics, non-invasive
   - use emperical evidence to course correct
4. Improvement
   - Enabling new ways of working and ensuring we retire the old ones (Organizational Debt)
