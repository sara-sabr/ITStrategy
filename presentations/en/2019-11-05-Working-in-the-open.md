# Working in the Open

---

## What

--

Your working material is available to all from its inception

Note:

- Drafts
- Planning
- Tasks

---

## Why

--

Early feedback loop

Note:

- Shift left, don't wait months to fix something that can be fixed now
- Peer review is very valuable

--

Economies of scale

Note:

- I don't know everything
- MANY problems are already solved
- Many solutions can be useful to problems/people you don't yet think of

>It's all about software engineering economics

Stephen Walli, Principal Program Manager at Microsoft

Note:

- Writing good code is hard
- If you work in the open and build a community, your team is bigger than you can hire

--

It makes your work discoverable

Note:

- It's hard to look for something you don't know exists
- It creates opportunities to create a community

---

## When

--

As soon as possible. Now.

Note:

- Don't wait until you had all your committees reviews
- Don't wait until it's perfect (it never is)
- Start your drafts in the open (improve the way you write)
- It's a lot harder to open up at the end
