# Working in the Open

---

## What

--

Your working material is available to all from its inception

Note:

- Drafts
- Planning
- Tasks

---

## Why

--

Early feedback loop

Note:

- Shift left
- Don't wait months to fix something that can be fixed now
- Peer review is very valuable

--

Economies of scale

Note:

- I don't know everything
- MANY problems are already solved
- Many solutions can be useful to problems/people you don't yet think of

## When

--

As soon as possible. Now.

Note:

Don't wait until you had all your committees reviews.
Start your drafts in the open (change the way you write)
