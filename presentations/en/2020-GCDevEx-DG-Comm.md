# Micro-procurement for digital work

ESDC IT Strategy team

@DG Committee (add date)

---

## Why look at an alternate way to procure digital work?

- Lot of time spent on formalizing small contracts
- Getting external help for ad-hoc development work is cumbersome
- Limited choice of external expertise

Note:

- keeping procurement officers busy
- hindering our ability to deliver high-quality IT solutions
- Supply arrangements are great but mostly for larger companies, those in the NCR and those who regularly get GC contracts. Barriers exist for small suppliers to access GC contract $.

---

## Who Cares?

- ESDC IT Strategy team
- Red tape reduction initiative
- Gartner
- Office of the Procurement Ombudsman (Canada)
- TBS Procurement policy team
- Office of Small and Medium Enterprise (PSPC)
- Canadian Digital Service
- Freelancers & Small and medium enterprises themselves

Note:

ESDC IT Strategy team:

- Procurement is a key piece of the puzzle that will take us to where we want to go.  If we want to be deploying rapidly, we need the process to procure services to be able to keep up and not add unnecessary lead time. ​
- But modernized procurement isn't just faster. It can also help us to continually improve by pushing us towards modern technologies and tools.​

## In the GC, each LDV procurement takes approximately

<img src="assets/images/67-working-days.png" alt="This image shows the following statistics: it takes 7 people, 8 days of touch time and 15 weeks to complete the average Low Dollar Value procurement in the GC.  This results in an 11% flow efficiency rate and 67 working days of wait time">

---

## What sort of contracts are we talking about?

- $10K and under
- Work that can be done remotely
- Work that is unclassified
- Open source code

Note:

- Risk is very low on LDV​ especially if under the proactive disclosure threshold of $10K
- LDV procurements go though many of the same steps as >$1M​
- Opportunity to better distribute GC contract $
- Big contracts will always go to big companies.  But with small contracts that the big players are less interested in, there is an opportunity to make it easier for folks other than the usual suspects to get contracts.​

## What if...

<img src="assets/images/GCDevEx-presentation.png" alt="This image shows a process flow scenario where the entire procurement takes only 72 hours.  Process items are shown using circles.  The first two process items of finding the bug and posting the opportunity are completed within 24 hours, the next two process items of bid received, and supplier selected are completed 24 hours after that, and finally the last two process items of Code submitted and checked and Code accepted and payment issued are completed in the last 24 hours">

Note:

You notice a bug in an open source component of an application.  You post a description of the bug online with a dollar value of what you would pay to fix the bug. Within 24 hours you have folks from across the country who have said they can fix it.  You look at their GitHub profile to verify that they have the skills and experience needed to fix the bug. You tell them to go for it.  They submit the code 24 hours after that. You check the code against acceptance criteria (including security), and if it is ok, you pull the code and provide payment.

## This is not about increasing outsourcing

---

## What sort of changes are we talking about?

- Procurement process for LDV simplified:
  - Fewer approvals required
  - Automation
- Culture change: priority given to procurement and invoicing activities
- Web tool for posting opportunities

---

## Alignment

- ESDC Mandate
- DOSP
- Digital Nations Charter commitment
- Directive on Service and Digital
- ESDC Investment Plan

Note:

- there is strong alignment to ESDC mandate of "works to improve the standard of living and quality of life for all Canadians. We do this by promoting a labour force that is highly skilled. We also promote an efficient and inclusive labour market."
- DOSP – Procurement Modernization, Agility, Open Source​
- Digital Nations Charter commitment (formerly D9) – Open Markets ​
- Directive on Service and Digital – Open First​
- ESDC Investment plan (2017-18 to 2022-23) – Use OSS​

---

## Who is already doing this?

- US Government
- BC Government
- QC Government (TBC)

Note:

- Lots of folks to learn from including: many external companies (e.g. Bug Bounty Programs and [goquotes.ca](https://goquotes.ca))
- US Government has a Micro-purchase threshold that they just increased to $10K
- BC Government has the BC Developers Exchange which recently became the 'Digital Marketplace'
- QC Government - Gabriel looking into this.

---

## If this is a good idea, why aren't we doing this in the GC?

- takes commitment from two teams: IT and Finance
- fear of making a mistake/losing delegated authority/getting fired
- we did

## The GC Developers Exchange

<img src="assets/images/gcdevex.jfif" alt="This image shows the former GC Developers Exchange website">

---

## What about:

- IP and copyright?
- Security of the code?

Note:

---

## What's Next?

- CIOEC
- CMC
- Launch pilot for GCDevEx v.2
  - Work with CFOB on a streamlined process for procurement and payment
  - Build app
  - Promote to diverse suppliers

## Frequently asked questions

Q: Can GC employees bid on GCDevEx opportunities?
A: Yes but they can't get paid for them ($ would transfer to their organization).

Q: How is this different from Talent Cloud? Could we use their platform?
A: Talent cloud is focused on HR processes, and GCDevEx is focused on procurement processes, so while there are synergies it's not a perfect fit.
