# Micro-procurement for digital work

ESDC IT Strategy team

@DG Committee (add date)

---

## Why look at an alternate way to procure digital work?

- Lot of time spent on formalizing small IT contracts
- Getting external help for ad-hoc development work is cumbersome
- Limited choice of external expertise

Note:

- keeping procurement officers busy
- hindering our ability to deliver high-quality IT solutions
- barriers exist for small suppliers to access GC contract $

---

## Who Cares?

- ESDC IT Strategy team
- Red tape reduction initiative
- Gartner
- TBS Procurement policy team
- Canadian Digital Service

---

## What sort of contracts are we talking about?

- $10K and under
- Work that can be done remotely
- Work that is unclassified
- Open source code

---

## Example:

You notice a bug in an open source component of an application.  You post a description of the bug online with a dollar value of what you would pay to fix the bug. Within 24 hours you have folks from across the country who have said they can fix it.  You look at their GitHub profile to verify that they have the skills and experience needed to fix the bug. You tell them to go for it.  They submit the code 24 hours after that. You check the code against acceptance criteria (including security), and if it is ok, you pull the code and provide payment.

## This is not about increasing outsourcing

---

## What sort of changes are we talking about?

Back-end:

- procurement process simplified:
  - Fewer approvals required
  - Automation
- Culture change: priority given to procurement and invoicing activities

Front end

- Web tool for posting opportunities

---

## Who is already doing this?

- US Government
- BC Government
- QC Government
  
Note:

- US Government has a Micro-purchase threshold that they just increased to $10K
- BC Government

---

## If this is a good idea, why aren't we doing this in the GC?

- takes commitment from two teams: IT and Finance
- fear of making a mistake/losing delegated authority/getting fired
