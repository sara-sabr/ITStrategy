# Working in the Open

## SSC Learn Architecture

Note:

- Been involved in Open Source Software for a long time.
- Open communities are the basis, but never worked in the open before.
- Until I joined the IT Strategy team
- Will share with you my experience and:
  - WHAT is Working in the Open
  - WHY you should work in the open
  - And HOW you should do it

---

## What

--

Your digital workspace is public and participatory

People can find and read its content

Note:

- Public and Participatory - [Mozilla - Working Open](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Working_open)
- Examples
  - Documents, including drafts
  - Planning
  - Tasks
  - Notes
  - Source code

--

You enable and encourage contributions

It's not just _working out loud_

Note:

- Not just sharing one way (e.g. Twitter, LinkedIn)
- Enable contributions, from anyone in the World!
- Take example of Open Source communities
  - Thousands of people working together
  - Various levels of contributions
- Do not force collaboration (see [HBR Collaborative Overload](https://hbr.org/2016/01/collaborative-overload))
  - It has to come organically (people interested, similar issues, etc.)
  - Can be sporadic or more involved (simple fixes, no commitments)

--

It's also a cultural thing

- Humility
- Willingness to learn and improve
- Inclusiveness
- Trust

Note:

- Humility, being humble
  - "I don't know everything. And it's okay because I want to learn and improve."
  - "I don't know you but I trust your contribution."
- Inclusiveness and accessibility
  - No discrimination
  - Encourage participation of everyone, from diverse backgrounds
- Trust
  - You trust your team
  - You trust this is good for the public

---

## Why

--

### 1. It's fun and rewarding!

- Efficient collaboration in modern tools from anywhere (e.g. GitHub)
- Easier to share your work
- Feels good to contribute to the common good
- You learn a lot, and meet new people!

Note:

- Modern: Single source of truth, merge changes, automatically generate website, automated checks

--

### 2. Improve productivity of organization

By making your work discoverable

According to [State of DevOps Report 2019](https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops/) (page 63):

<div style="text-align:left">

_**External Search**_

- _Feeling productive_
- _Strong communities for learning and growing_
- _Recruiting, an important side benefit_

</div>

Note:

- It's hard to look for information (just too much)
  - But if it's in the Open, it can at least be found
- Makes collaboration easier (more organic, less rigid)

--

### 3. Avoid duplication of work

MANY problems are already solved

Note:

- Lots of redundancies across teams, branches and departments
- Because a workspace is discoverable, you may reuse existing content
- Adapt instead of building from scratch (or buying something)

--

### 4. Generate economies of scale

For your organization and outside

Note:

- Reuse solutions or documents from other open communities
- Contributions benefit everyone (e.g. OSS, Wikipedia)
- With a community, your team is bigger than # of people you could hire

--

### 5. Get early Feedback

To be agile, in an unpredictable world

- Early course correction to avoid waste
- Peer review is very valuable

--

### 6. Increase quality of work

- _"When other people can see your work, you tend to raise your game"_ ([UK GDS](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/09/04/the-benefits-of-coding-in-the-open/))
- Learn from others -> Increase your expertise
- External contributions

Note:

- Encourages good practice (people will see your work!)
  - In software development, improve security, accountability and sustainability

---

## When

--

As soon as possible, now

> Don't wait until it's perfect, it never will be

Note:

- Don't wait for approval, start your drafts in the open
- It's a lot harder to open up at the end

--

It's strongly encouraged!

<div style="text-align:left">

[GC Digital Standards](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html)

_**Work in the open by default**_

_**Collaborate widely**_

_Share and collaborate in the open. Identify and create partnerships ..._
