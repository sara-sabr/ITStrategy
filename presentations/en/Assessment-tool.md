## DevOps Research & Assessment

The State of DevOps research program represents six years of research and data from over 31,000 professionals worldwide.
It is the longest running academically rigorous research investigation of its kind, providing an independent view into the practices and **capabilities that drive high performance in technology** delivery and ultimately organizational outcomes.

## How to Transform

### Continuous Improvement

--

### Replace with visual

1. Org sets aspirational goal
2. Teams assess current condition
3. Teams sets measurable targets for a future date
4. Teams look for with ways to achieve goals (PCDA)
5. Teams run experiments daily to move towards the target conditions
6. Results are captured, new targets are set, repeat the process.

--

### Step 1

Start with a direction (a "true north") at the organizational or division level.
This is an aspirational, system-level goal, for example

- Lead time for change [1-24] hours
- Deploy frequency [1-24] hours or on demand
- Time to restore service [1-24] hours
- [Generative (Westrum) Culture](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-culture-westrum-organizational-culture)

--

### Step 2

Understand the current condition

- The assesment tool

--

### Step 3

Set measurable targets for a future date.

- What are your "sprints"?
- 1, 2 or 3 weeks
- Quarterly

--

### Step 4

Teams experiment with ways to achieve these goals until the future date is reached, supported by management.
Scientific approach to experimentation, using the PDCA method (Plan-Do-Check-Act), also known as the Deming cycle.

- Plan: determine the expected outcome.
- Do: perform the experiment.
- Check: study the results.
- Act: decide what to do next.

--

### Step 5

Teams should be running experiments daily to try to move towards the target conditions or key results.

- What are the current and target conditions?
- What obstacles do you think are preventing you from reaching the target condition?
- Which one are you addressing now?
- What is your next step? What outcomes do you expect?
- When can the results be evaluated to see what can be learned from taking that step?

--

### Step 6

When the results have been captured and new targets are set, repeat the process.
