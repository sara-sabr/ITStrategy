1. IITB sets aspirational goal
2. Teams seek to understand the current condition
3. Teams sets measurable targets for a future date
4. Teams run experiments on a daily basis to move towards the target conditions, using PDCA method:
   1. **Plan** : determine the expected outcome.
   2. **Do** : perform the experiment.
   3. **Check** : study the results.
   4. **Act** : decide what to do next.
5. Teams captured, set new targets, repeat 2-5.

- When can the results be evaluated to see what can be learned from taking that step?
