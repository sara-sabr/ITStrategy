## Why are we here?

Promote continuous improvement through the use of a **DevOps Self Assessment Tool**, that evaluates following capabilities: 

- Technical
- Process
- Measurement
- Cultural

> DevOps is beyond technical!

### Continuous Improvement Transformation

<img src="assets/images/AssessmentTool1.jpg" alt="This image shows how to improve team transformation. There are five stages of improvement: 1. Setting goals - where IITB sets aspirational goal. 2. Current condition - where teams seek to understand the current condition. 3. Measurable targets - where teams set measurable targets for a future date. 4. Running experiments -where teams run experiments on a daily basis to move towards the target conditions, using PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act) method. 5. New targets - where teams capture, set new targets and going to repat the process 2-3 times. The image also demonstrates PDCA method. Plan - determine the expected outcome. Do - perform the experiment. Check- study the results. Act - decide what to do next.">

### IITB Aspirational Goal

#### Direction (a "true north")

- Lead time for changes [1-24] hours
- Change or deploy frequency [1-24] hours or on demand
- Time to restore service [1-24] hours
- [Generative (Westrum) Culture](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-culture-westrum-organizational-culture)

### Running experiments

#### Ask the following questions

- What are the current and target conditions?
- What obstacles do you think are preventing you from reaching the target condition?
- Which one are you addressing now?
- What is your next step? What outcomes do you expect?
- When can the results be evaluated to see what can be learned from taking that step?
