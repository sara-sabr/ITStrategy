## DevOps Research & Assessment

The State of DevOps research program represents six years of research and data from over 31,000 professionals worldwide.
It is the longest running academically rigorous research investigation of its kind, providing an independent view into the practices and **capabilities that drive high performance in technology** delivery and ultimately organizational outcomes.

## How to Transform

### Continuous Improvement

https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-culture-transform

--

### Replace with visual

1. Org sets aspirational goal
2. Teams assess current condition
3. Teams sets measurable targets for a future date
4. Teams look for with ways to achieve goals (PCDA)
5. Teams run experiments daily to move towards the target conditions
6. Results are captured, new targets are set, repeat the process.

--

### Step 1

Start with a direction (a "true north") at the organizational or division level.
This is an aspirational, system-level goal, for example

- Lead time for change [1-24] hours
- Deploy frequency [1-24] hours or on demand
- Time to restore service [1-24] hours
- [Generative (Westrum) Culture](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-culture-westrum-organizational-culture)

--

### Step 2

Understand the current condition

- The assesment tool

--

### Step 3

Set measurable targets for a future date.

- What are your "sprints"?
- 1, 2 or 3 weeks
- Quarterly

--

### Step 4

Teams experiment with ways to achieve these goals until the future date is reached, supported by management.
Scientific approach to experimentation, using the PDCA method (Plan-Do-Check-Act), also known as the Deming cycle.

- Plan: determine the expected outcome.
- Do: perform the experiment.
- Check: study the results.
- Act: decide what to do next.

--

### Step 5

Teams should be running experiments daily to try to move towards the target conditions or key results.

- What are the current and target conditions?
- What obstacles do you think are preventing you from reaching the target condition?
- Which one are you addressing now?
- What is your next step? What outcomes do you expect?
- When can the results be evaluated to see what can be learned from taking that step?

--

### Step 6

When the results have been captured and new targets are set, repeat the process.

Questions
=======
## Why are we here?

Promote continuous improvement through the use of a **DevOps Self Assessment Tool**, that evaluates following capabilities: 

- Technical
- Process
- Measurement
- Cultural

> DevOps is beyond technical!

---

## Why use the tool?

- Learn about DevOps
- Help Establish a baseline on level of readiness and maturity to adopt DevOps
- Recommendations on where and what to improve based on assessment results
- Encourage continuous improvement
- Aligned to Policy and Directive on Service and Digital
-

### __ Replace with visual __

1. IITB sets aspirational goal
2. Teams seek to understand the current condition
3. Teams sets measurable targets for a future date
4. Teams run experiments on a daily basis to move towards the target conditions, using PDCA method:
   1. **Plan** : determine the expected outcome.
   2. **Do** : perform the experiment.
   3. **Check** : study the results.
   4. **Act** : decide what to do next.
5. Teams captured, set new targets, repeat 2-5.

## What is it based on?

DevOps Research & Assessment (DORA)*

- Over six years of research
- Data from over 31,000 professionals worldwide

Identifies **capabilities that drive high performance in technology** delivery and ultimately organizational outcomes.

## How does it work?

Survey with 11 sections

Teams are encouraged to fill out every section, but it is possible to fill out individual sections independently

--

## How does it work, continued

[Demo](https://sara-sabr.github.io/dora-js/)

---

## How long does it take and how often should I use it?

The complete assessment takes under an hour, each sections takes 3-5 minutes.

</br>

We recommend that you use the self assessment tool every 6-12 months to measure your teams progress and to reestablish your baseline.
