### Continuous Improvement

--

### Step 1

Start with a direction (a "true north") at the organizational or division level.
This is an aspirational, system-level goal, for example

- Lead time for change [1-24] hours
- Deploy frequency [1-24] hours or on demand
- Time to restore service [1-24] hours

--

### Step 2

Understand the current condition

- The assesment tool

--

### Step 3

Set measurable targets for a future date.

- Quarterly

--

### Step 4

Teams experiment with ways to achieve these goals until the future date is reached, supported by management.
Scientific approach to experimentation, using the PDCA method (Plan-Do-Check-Act), also known as the Deming cycle.

- Plan: determine the expected outcome.
- Do: perform the experiment.
- Check: study the results.
- Act: decide what to do next.

--

### Step 5

Teams should be running experiments daily to try to move towards the target conditions or key results.

- What are the current and target conditions?
- What obstacles do you think are preventing you from reaching the target condition?
- Which one are you addressing now?
- What is your next step? What outcomes do you expect?
- When can the results be evaluated to see what can be learned from taking that step?

--

### Step 6

When the results have been captured and new targets are set, repeat the process.
