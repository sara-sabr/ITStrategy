## What is the Micro-Acquisition pilot?

A one-year experimental pilot procurement vehicle for custom code licensed as open source. All work must:

- Have a value of $10K or less
- Be unclassified
- Be virtual
- Be done in an open repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab)

Note:

- Why $10K or less?  Risk is very low on Low Dollar Value procurements under the sole source threshold. Even more so for those​ under the proactive disclosure threshold of $10K
- Opportunities for micro-acquisitions will reduce barriers for suppliers (e.g. security clearance is not required if the work is all unclassified)
- remote work - this goes without saying now because of COVID but the important point to note here is that in addition to physical access, no remote access to ESDC networks is required. Nor is the use for any ESDC devices. This along with the 'unclassified work only' requirement would mean that suppliers would not need to be GC security cleared.
- work is done openly so that all work is available for re-use

- Through a **simplified and expedited** process that **reduces the barriers** that these organizations (including start-ups) and freelancers face, and a **targeted communications strategy** (to diverse businesses such as those that are Black, and Indigenous led), this pilot is **expected to increase access to IT talent that the GC is currently missing out on**
- Why do we want to do this?  Because strategic procurement of open source code can bring knowledge into IT teams that is not currently there. Suppliers can be contracted to solve problems and when they turn over the open source code, ESDC IT teams will be able to learn from suppliers in almost a train the trainer sort of way. This would enable IITB to build capacity in-house and embed modern tools and practices within IITB teams.
- Further, contributions to GC open source projects, or open source projects being leveraged by the GC, has the **potential to be leveraged as a recruitment tool** for IITB. (CDS has experienced this with COVID Alert)

## Expected Benefits

- Increased participation and access to developers who wouldn’t normally bid on GC IT contracts
- Increased working in the open by ESDC
- Reduced workload burden on ESDC procurement officers
- Increased ESDC capabilities around agile, including breaking work up into smaller chunks
- Increased speed of payment of suppliers

Note:

- 95% of SMEs surveyed in 2017 do not see the GC as a buyer. In a recent procurement ombudsman report GC standing offers and supply arrangements are 'cumbersome to use and difficult to qualify for. They also seem to disproportionately favour suppliers in the NCR'. As a result, the GC doesn't get the opportunity to benefit from many of the amazing developer talent that exists in Canada.
- We think that having a procurement vehicle that nudges folks towards working in the open open will help us move towards alignment with the digital standards. Often when custom code is procured, the government gains the rights to do what it wants with it, however typically code is not shared within ESDC or with other departments.
- procurement officers are facing even more capacity issues now during COVID. In their Procurement in 2020 and Beyond report, Gartner recommends 5 shifts regarding digital procurement. One of these involves shifting the ownership for low and mid-tier purchases away from corporate procurement teams so that they can focus primarily on strategic, high value, high-risk purchases.
- breaking work out into smaller work packages enables same-day delivery and drives high organizational performance
- 30 days to pay is a barrier that prevents a lot of small suppliers from participating on GC contracts. We think that faster payment will encourage those who wouldn't normally to apply and in doing so will allow the GC to access a broader range of talent.

- but what about existing procurement vehicles?  Yep....ProServices is a great supply arrangement from PSPC but getting on the pre-approved list of suppliers takes time (often 6 months) and has requirements that create barriers to those who are newly working in the field of IT or in the gig economy.
- Capacity on Demand contracts are an excellent procurement innovation that once set up allows procurement to happen in weeks, however, the contracts are established with a single company which often means freelancers and start-ups are less likely to bid.

## Alignment

- ESDC Mandate
- Digital Standards
- Digital Operations Strategic Plan
- Digital Nations Charter commitment
- Directive on Service and Digital
- ESDC Investment Plan

Note:

- there is strong alignment to policy and mandate for this experimental pilot ESDC's mandate of "works to improve the standard of living and quality of life for all Canadians. We do this by promoting a labour force that is highly skilled. We also promote an efficient and inclusive labour market." It makes ESDC a good fit to lead this initiative. Especially during COVID when many are facing unemployment and underemployment.
- GC Digital Standards - Work in the open and use open standards and solutions. Work in the open = Make all new code developed in delivery of services open to the outside world for sharing and reuse under an open license
- Digital Operations Strategic Plan – which speaks to the need for Procurement Modernization for IT specifically, Agility, and Open Source​
- Digital Nations Charter commitment (formerly D9) – Open Standards, Open Source, Open Markets, Open Government, and which Canada is a signatory
- Directive on Service and Digital – This directive includes mandatory procedures for EA assessment. These procedures include: "Where possible, use open standards and open source software first" and "If a custom-built application is the appropriate option, by default any source code written by the government must be released in an open format via Government of Canada websites and  services designated by the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat" and "All source code must be released under an appropriate open source software license"
- ESDC Investment plan (2017-18 to 2022-23) – Emphasizes the use of OSS​

## Project schedule/milestones

- **March 2021:** Project approval
- **April 2021:** Mock-up approved
- **May 2021:** Development and testing
- **June 2021 - June 2022:** Pilot in operation
- **June 2022:** Project close-out

Note:

- "development and testing" includes the development of the technical solution but also the development of the processes, the generic terms and conditions, the user documentation, the audit and monitoring process, and communication pieces

---

## Solution Architecture and Design

All existing products and/or Approved Tech Bricks

- Stand-alone website to post opportunities
- Free hosting via GitHub pages
- Procured code will be shared on GitHub or Gitlab
- Actual procurement and payment will be done via existing systems (e.g., SAP)

Note:

- Stand alone website to be accessible by the general public
- Build and Admin for the site to be done by the IT Strategy Team
- All opportunities will be reviewed by both IT Strategy and initially CFOB to ensure rules are met

---

## The non-technical build

1. Simplified procurement processes -  
    e.g., Payment via credit card/PayPal
2. Procurement guardrails (e.g., contract splitting)
3. One page generic terms and conditions

---

## Minimizing Risk

- Partnership with CFOB
- Quality Assurance on procured code
- Taking lessons learned from others who have done micro-procurement
- Tabletop exercise with stakeholders using personas and scenarios
- Using standard safeguards against outsourcing

Note:

- to help us navigate through procurement rules and legal considerations - contract splitting (using a combo of education and audit), monitoring and auditing. With CFOB (their IP CoE) we are developing a one page terms and conditions document to cover IP concerns.
- There will be QA of code that is submitted. If delivered code doesn't pass the documented acceptance criteria, suppliers will not be paid. Security screening will we one of the QA elements. Various options to look at including automated tools (e.g. for code on GitHub, they have a code scanning feature). We've talked to CDS about this as they also only use open source code.... "we had Semmle's previous offering "LGTM" as a requirement for all CDS OS projects, and so will transition it all over to this (code scanning)".  We are working with Solutions Architecture to think through standard acceptance criteria and guidance to ensure code meets quality standards as set out in gc directives and policies. We also have the opportunity through this procurement pilot to link up and promote things like Test Driven Development and DevOps.
- Industry (bug bounty), US, BC, GCDevEx
- tabletop exercise is important to ensure that we haven't inadvertently put up barriers to suppliers or clients
- safeguards around outsourcing relates to concerns we might see from the Unions. We firmly believe that this is not about increasing outsourcing.  The micro-procurements are intended to supplement the work of employees in short bursts where capacity (from time, knowledge, etc.) issues exist. Once these barriers have been removed, employees can progress with their work. CFOB has advised that there is standard language that is often used in contracting to ease concerns about outsourcing (e.g., confirm that 'this is a standalone piece of work and no internal capacity exists).

## Annex A: Others doing Micro-purchasing

- Private industry
- US Government
- BC Government
- Yukon Government (in development)
- QC Government (in development)

Note:

- Lots of folks for us to learn from who are already doing this
- Many external companies (e.g., Bug Bounty Programs and [goquotes.ca](https://goquotes.ca))
- US Government has a Micro-purchase threshold that they just increased to $10K and a number of teams are experimenting with this threshold around the procurement of open source code
- BC Government has the BC Digital Marketplace (run by their BC Developers Exchange team) which is their micro-procurement platform.  They have had this for many years. They started small and ultimately went up to $70K for their micro-procurement 'Code with us' platform and as much as $2M for their associated 'Sprint with us' platform. They have really led the way and we are connected with them and learning from them.
- QC Government - had conversations with them...they are also looking at implementing micro-procurement of open source code

## Annex B: The GC Developers Exchange

<img src="assets/images/gcdevex.jfif" alt="This image shows the former GC Developers Exchange website">

Note:

- The GC Developers Exchange was the GC's first experiment with micro-procurement for open source code.
  - It was launched in 2017 by Privy Council Office (in partnership with TBS and PSPC).
  - It was built on code that was forked from the BC Developers Exchange.
  - All contracts awarded via GCDevEx were $10K and under, and were for virtual and unclassified work only (eliminating the need for a supplier security check).
- The GCDevEx pilot created many lessons learned:
  - a **simplified back-end process is required** not just a front end to connect the GC with developers
  - GC isn't used to breaking work into smaller chunks
  - the proposal creation process needs to be easier (no more than 2 hrs of work for supplier and also not overly burdensome for clients)
- The pilot was shelved at PCO after one contract as we were unable to get the finance folks on board to change back end processes and also due to resourcing issues and mandate of the department.
