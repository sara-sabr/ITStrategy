## Why

--

Directive on Management of Information Technology

>C.2.3.8.3 If a custom-built application is the appropriate option, by default any source code written by the government must be released in an open format via Government of Canada websites and services designated by the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat

--

Directive on Management of Information Technology

>C.2.3.8.4 All source code must be released under an appropriate open source software license

Upcoming - April 1st, 2020

But, also:

* Encourages [best coding practices](https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/2017/02/21/why-we-code-in-the-open/)
* It aligns with our goal of being an open government by releasing [data and information of value to citizens](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=28108#sec5.1).
* Find people with similar problems that could be interested in helping you ([ORE](https://github.com/canada-ca/ore-ero))
* Find new usage to your software ([AIA](https://github.com/canada-ca/aia-eia-js))

Note:

* UK Ministry of Justice found that the quality and readability of their code improved
* Government wants to be more transparent but also bring value to its work
* ORE found partners in cities across the country
* People found that the AIA could be leveraged for other assessments

## First task

(15 minutes)

--

Let's start by uploading your project to your GitHub profile

Note:

(Reuse the small website project)

--

1. Follow the [GitHub instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line)

--

2. Choose a licence

(You can reuse [TL;DR Legal](https://tldrlegal.com) to help you pick)

Note:

Take the time to go through this exercise and we'll chat a bit after

--

Which licence did you pick and why?

How did you display the licence notice?

---

## Crown Copyright

Technically, the work we do in the office is Crown Copyright, it belongs to Her Majesty in right of Canada.

--

### Notice

Include a Copyright notice in the LICENCE file:

> Copyright (c) Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as represented by the Minister of (legal departmental name), (year of publication).

Replace the (legal departmental name) and (year of publication) with the appropriate information.

--

Include a notice in your README.md

--

>Unless otherwise noted, the source code of this project is covered under Crown Copyright, Government of Canada, and is distributed under the MIT License.

--

>The Canada wordmark and related graphics associated with this distribution are protected under trademark law and copyright law. No permission is granted to use them outside the parameters of the Government of Canada's corporate identity program. For more information, see Federal identity requirements.

--

### Licence

The licence you choose has to be applied by the owner's duly authorized agent.

Typically, this is an Assistant Deputy Minister or someone with the delegated authority in your department, like for Open Data.
