## Definitions

--

What is open source software?

Note:

To define OSS, we need to define software

--

### Algorithm

>"A procedure for solving a mathematical problem [...] in a finite number of steps that frequently involves repetition of an operation"
>
>**Broadly**: "A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing some end"[^fn]

[^fn]: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/algorithm

--

### Source Code

>Source code is the version of a computer program as it is originally written (i.e., typed into a computer) by a human in a programming language.[^fn]

[^fn]:"http://www.linfo.org/object_code.html"

--

### Object Code

>Object code is the output of a compiler after it processes source code.[^fn]

[^fn]:"http://www.linfo.org/object_code.html"

--

### Software

>The programs and other operating information used by a  computer. (at runtime)

--

## Copyright

>Copyright is the exclusive legal right to produce, reproduce, publish or perform an original literary, artistic, dramatic or musical work.

--

### Copyright & Licences

Software licences give you certain rights under certain conditions

---

## Open Source Software

>Software available under an open source licence.

For the purpose of the Government of Canada, we consider the Open Source Initiative's [definition](https://opensource.org/docs/definition.php) the current standard.

--

### Basic Rights

1. Use the software as you wish
2. Study the source code
3. Modify the source code
4. Redistribute the software

--

### Conditions

1. Notice
2. Derived work's licence

--

### It's not open source

If you only have access to the source code.

>You **must** have the rights based on an open source licence.

---

## Types of Open Source Licences

--

### Permissive

>Allows you to do what you want with it and distribute it under different conditions than you obtained it.

--

### Reciprocal (Copyleft)

>Allow you to do the same but require you to redistribute on the same conditions under which you obtained it.

---

## First Task

Find if the licence is permissive or reciprocal

(10 minutes)

--

Choose an Open Source Licence:

* MIT License (Expat)
* Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)
* BSD 3-Clause License (Revised)
* Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)
* GNU General Public License v3 (GPL-3)
* GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPL-3.0)

Use [TL;DR Legal](https://tldrlegal.com)

Note:

* Find out if it's a permissive or reciprocal licence
* Provide the main conditions under which you can use it

--

> Why bother?

It looks like a lot of work...

---

## Second Task

Build a basic website supporting blog posts.

(15 minutes)

--

The application should have:

* A homepage
* A basic blog post

(Don't worry about the look and feel)

--

You can type out your HTML/CSS if you want.

Or you can use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

## Why

Directive on Management of IT and upcoming Directive on Service and Digital (April 1st, 2020)

--

But also:

* Don't start with a blank canvas, focus on the added value
* Speed up development time by reusing existing solutions to common problems
* Leverage a large community of peers to enhance quality and for wider maintenance
* Build on top of giants' shoulders and communities

Note:

How big is your team? As of 2019-10-10:

* Jekyll: 864 contributors
* Hugo: 588 contributors

> Aspiring to world class is not enough, when everyone else starts there

Jeff McAffer, formerly Director of Microsoft's Open Source Program Office

Note:

Startups combine open source software components and focus on added value

> The number of open source components in the codebase of *proprietary* applications keeps rising

--

> 96 percent of the scanned applications contain open source components, with an average 257 components per application [...]

HelpNetSecurity, May 22, 2018 - [The percentage of open source code in proprietary apps is rising](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/05/22/open-source-code-security-risk/)

--

> The average percentage of open source in the codebases of the applications scanned grew from 36% last year to 57%, suggesting that a large number of applications now contain much more open source than proprietary code.

Note:

* Doesn't mean to stop purchasing software licences
* Modern software development is about reusing powerful OSS
  * Components
  * Frameworks

--

>It's all about software engineering economics

Stephen Walli, Principal Program Manager at Microsoft

Note:

Writing good code takes a lot of time

---

## How

By using:

* Package Managers
  * NPM, Anaconda, Maven, CocoaPods, RubyGems, etc.
* Frameworks
  * Bootstrap, Spring, React.js, Spark, Django, .NET, etc.
* Social Development Platforms
  * GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, GCcode*

--

### Support Models

* In-house
* Professional Services

---

## Be secure
  
* Know your dependencies
* Assess the components
* Patch your stuff!

Note:

* Equifax could have [prevented data breach](https://www.wired.com/story/equifax-breach-no-excuse/) if it had patched it's software
* Vulnerability was known for 6 weeks and a patch was available

--

### Resources

* MITRE's [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)](https://cve.mitre.org/)
* [U.S. National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/)

--

### Tools

* FOSSA
* JFrog X-Ray
* Sonatype
* Synopsys
* Etc.

---

## Be Compliant

* Know your dependencies
* Comply with T&Cs of the licences

--

### Rights and Responsibilities

Inbound vs Outbound

--

The terms and conditions under which you will be distributing your software must not exceed the terms and conditions associated with the licences of the software you will be using in your project.

> "Say what?"

--

### Project distribution

Within GC departments != Distribution

But

An external website will be considered distribution
