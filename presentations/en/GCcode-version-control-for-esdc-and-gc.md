# GCcode

## Version Control for ESDC and GC

### The Ask

Provide support in evolving [GCcode](https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca) platform (Version Control and Project Management) to become officially supported within the GC

**Goal:** Enable maximum sharing and reuse

---

### ESDC Context

[ESDC Open Source Software Management Framework](http://dialogue/grp/TAWS-ATST/Collaboration+Architecture+Services/Projects/Artificial+Intelligence+and+Open+Source/OSS/ESDC+Open+Source+Management+Framework+v+1.2.docx)

Endorsed at ARC – September 2019

- Use Open Source Software (OSS)
- Contribute to OSS communities
- Publish code as OSS

---

### GC Context

[Directive on Management of IT](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15249)

- _All source code must be released ..._
- _Share code publicly when appropriate, and when not, share within the GC_

[GC Digital Standards](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html)

**Work in the open by default**  
Make all non-sensitive [...] new code developed in delivery of services open to the outside world for sharing and reuse under an open licence

---

### Current State

Each department manages its own internal Version Control/Project Management platforms

> ESDC has a mix of TFS, SVN and GitLab (Azure)

For open source code and working in the open, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) hosting is recommended

> ESDC is using mostly Github.com

---

### GCcode

SSC maintains an unofficial "best effort" shared instance called GCcode (internal to GC), based on [GitLab](ghttps://about.gitlab.com) OSS:

- ≈3600 projects and ≈3000 users
- 350+ users from ESDC
- 50 GC organizations
- 17k+ issues and 8k merge requests

(As of May 2019)

https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca

### Proposal

To increase sharing/reuse in the GC

1. Evolve GCcode as an officially supported internal Version Control and Project Management platform for the GC community, with assistance from ESDC (e.g. funding)
2. Make it the default working environment for all source code projects in ESDC

Not just a copy of the code, it's where teams work.  
A stepping stone to working in the open by default!

---

### More than just source code

- **Projects** (groups, repositories)
- **Issues** (bugs, features, tasks)
- **Kanban** (prioritize/visualize tasks)
- **Continuous Integration** (automated testing)
- **Wiki**
- **Websites** (GC theme available)
- **Integration** with other systems
- ...

See [GitLab Features](https://about.gitlab.com/features/)

## Why not Github.com?

---

### Advantages of public SaaS

**1. Provider's Infrastructure**  
_Popular SaaS providers usually have resources and ability to stay current and innovate_

**2. Work in complete Openness**  
_Allow employees to work in the open with the world_

**3. Private Repositories**  
_Private projects are available for free with limitations (3 collaborators) or as part of a subscription ($)_

---

### Drawbacks of public SaaS

**1. Comfort Level with Openness**  
_Teams can be reluctant to work completely in the open_

**2. Vendor Lock-in**  
_No control over provider's roadmap_

**3. Expensive**  
_Licensing of private repositories at GC level could be expensive compared to private open source platform_

**4. Low power of influence over SaaS**  
_Difficult to influence the direction of a SaaS compared to OSS project open to contributions_

---

### SaaS vs GCcode

#### SaaS

- Available on the Internet
- Unclassified information only
- No control over platform (risk of lock-in)

#### GCcode

- Available on GC network
- Unclassified information only but could be certified Protected B
- Open source instance of [GitLab](ghttps://about.gitlab.com) OSS that we control

---

### Benefits for IITB

- **Cost savings** through consolidation
- Strengthen **relationship** between IT and business through a common platform
- Improve the **quality and security** of code with automated testing
- **Accelerate** the rate of development and deployments
- **Discover/reuse** code from other projects (incl. other depts)
- Obtain metrics/statistics for **reporting** and continuous improvement

---

### Benefits for Existing Projects

- Benefit from a **common** development platform  
- Enhance **planning** of feature development through a single view
- **Automate** tracking of work
- Ensure **accountability** by logging changes and incidents
- Improve code **quality** and **collaboration** by developing in the open

---

### Proposal

1. Evolve GCcode as an officially supported internal Version Control and Project Management platform for the GC community, with assistance from ESDC (e.g. funding)

1. Make it the default working environment for all source code projects in ESDC (visibility: GC-wide or private)

---

### Next Steps

1. Commence discussions with business owner of GCcode (SSC CIO)
1. Determine and plan evolution of the service (business model, service models, hosting environment, etc.)
1. As required, set funding agreement(s) with ESDC and other departments
1. Implement technical changes & Formalize a support team within SSC
1. Update ESDC OSS Guidance (e.g. When to choose GCcode vs GitHub)
