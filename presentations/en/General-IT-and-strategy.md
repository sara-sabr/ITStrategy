  - Targeted network fix now (end-user experience, infrastructure, data centres, the North)
  - Boost 11 OAS processing centres across the country
  - Rebuilding the ESDC network to support future needs (for mobile and cloud)
- e.g., PoC: grassroots innovation program, chatbot, acceleration hub, co-design with citizens
- On Technical Debt: Corporate Risk Profile identified IT as its #1 risk (age of systems)

### IITB's internal Priorities

- Sustainability Plan
- Upkeep of existing systems throughout their life cycle
- Build capacity for new technologies (e.g., Cloud)
- Attracting and retaining talent (attrition)
- [IITB Way Forward](http://dialogue/grp/IITB-DGIIT-Gov-New-Nouveau/Documents/Departmental%20IMIT%20Plan/19-20%20Plans/IITB%20Moving%20Forward%20v2.docx)

Note:

- Sustainability plan: financing legacy systems until BDM can replace them
- APM - systems evolve over time and must be kept up to date (patching, security, versioning from vendors)
- upkeep e.g.: migrating or eliminating 70 applications
- attrition: average age is 45.8, and 10.9% eligible to retire in next 5 years
- IITB Way Forward: 26 service improvement and internal modernization activities to improve our service offerings

### Technology is ubiquitous

Note:

- Show the image at the beginning of the presentation
- The proportion of IT in the department does not reflect a single branch, technology is everywhere

## 3. The IT Strategy

### Premise

- The digital world is **complex** and **uncertain**.
- Instead of advance planning and rigid plan execution, we must use an emperical cycle of **trying**, **observing**, and **correcting**

Note:

- Many external forces:
  - upcoming [TB Policy on Service and Digital](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32603)
  - [GC Digital Operations Strategic Plan](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-operations-strategic-plan-2018-2022.html)
  - [OneGC Vision](https://gccollab.ca/groups/profile/154708/enonegc-ungcfrungc)
  - [BDM](http://esdc.prv/en/intersection/2019/10/tr1_10-21_1571928232401.shtml)

--

### Focus of the IT Strategy

_Change the relationship IT has with "The Business"_

- From a **contracting** model one
- To a **partnership** one

_We are all on the same team, looking to solve problems_

Note:

- Contracting: expects business requirements and we deliver on requirements
- Partnership: we are one team looking to solve a problem

--

### What it means

_Shared accountability_

- Lines of business must understand the costs and risks associated with technology
- IT must be able to keep up with business changes

Note:

- What business problem(s), specifically, do we think investment in technology will solve?
- large projects are risky and may spend money where it's not needed
- reduce the space between the user and the IT team working to help her
- what is written in MS Word does not produce warning/errors until they are in systems
- Keep up with demand: IT must deliver much faster

--

### How we are **doing** strategy making

In the Open. All are welcome and invited to comment and contribute to the strategies at all times

Customers, private sector partners, other levels of government, or other departments...

[Link to our workspace](https://sara-sabr.github.io/ITStrategy)

Note:

- We purposefully put our content on the internet so that it is discoverable and shareable outside ESDC

--

### Focused areas of the IT Strategy

- Increase responsiveness of IT
- Reduce IT investment size
- Adoption of Open Source, as a philosophy
- Invest in automation to allow staff to focus on meaningful work
- Enable IITB teams to design for users with users, iterate and improve frequently

Link to [Strategy Map](strategy-summary.html)

Note:

- Responsiveness: using cloud technologies, automation, and new methods of workiong (e.g. product mgt). Goal to have daily releases to production
- Reduce investment size: to reduce risk to the organization
- Product Mgt: This has financial model implication
- Product Mgt: achieve locality of decisions (loose coupling and independence) to increase responsiveness
- DORA: Institute that studies high-performing technology organizations
- Open Source: part of the [Mandate of the new Digital Minister](https://pm.gc.ca/en/mandate-letters/minister-digital-government-mandate-letter)
- Open Source: can be used to attract talent! and benefit from economies of scale
- IT investments: reduce risks to the organization, treating business cases like a hypothesis

--

### Goals

- Get the user _IN_ the development process
- Enable ESDC to be an agile organization (iterate and improve frequently)
- Align with overall GC IT Direction
- Improve 4 key metrics <sup>1</sup>:
  - Lead time for changes
  - Deployment frequency
  - Time to restore service
  - Change failure rate

<sup>1</sup>[DORA research](https://cloud.google.com/devops)

Note:

- Agile org: that can respond to change, that can iterate and improve frequently
- Agile org: currently elaborating a PoC framework
- GC IT Direction: Policy on Service and Digital, Digital Standards, Digital Strategic Operation Plan, OneGC
- GC IT Direction: highly complex. Will need to be able to respond fast when requirements get in
