## 3. The IT Strategy

### Premise

> To work effectively in the digital world, you must first accept complexity and uncertainty, for they demand very different approach to carrying out initiatives. A predictable world rewards advanced planning and rigid plan execution. But a complex and uncertain world rewards an empirical cycle of trying, observing, and correcting

Note:

- Many external forces:
  - upcoming [TB Policy on Service and Digital](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32603)
  - [GC Digital Operations Strategic Plan](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-operations-strategic-plan-2018-2022.html)
  - [OneGC Vision](https://gccollab.ca/groups/profile/154708/enonegc-ungcfrungc)
  - [BDM](http://esdc.prv/en/intersection/2019/10/tr1_10-21_1571928232401.shtml)

--

### Focus of the IT Strategy

_Change the relationship IT has with "The Business"_

- From a **contracting** model one
- To a **partnership** one

_We are all on the same team, looking to solve problems_

Note:

- Contracting: expects business requirements and we deliver on requirements
- Partnership: we are one team looking to solve a problem

--

### What it means

_Shared accountability_

- Lines of business must understand the costs and risks associated with technology
- IT must be able to keep up with business changes

Note:

- What business problem(s), specifically, do we think investment in technology will solve?
- large projects are risky and may spend money where it's not needed
- reduce the space between the user and the IT team working to help her
- what is written in MS Word does not produce warning/errors until they are in systems
- Keep up with demand: IT must deliver much faster

--

### How we are **doing** strategy making

In the Open. All are welcome and invited to comment and contribute to the strategies at all times

Customers, private sector partners, other levels of government, or other departments...

Note:

- We purposefully put our content on the internet so that it is discoverable and shareable outside ESDC

--

### Focused areas of the IT Strategy

- Increase responsiveness of IT
- Moving from Project to Product Management
- 21 DevOps capabilities (DORA), including job satisfaction
- Adoption of Open Source, as a philosophy
- Automation to allow staff to focus on meaningful work
- Enable IITB teams to design for users with users, iterate and improve frequently

Link to [Strategy Map](strategy-summary.html)

Note:

- Responsiveness: using cloud technologies and automation. Goal to have daily releases to production
- Product Mgt: This has financial model implication
- Product Mgt: achieve locality of decisions (loose coupling and independence) to increase responsiveness
- DORA: Institute that studies high-performing technology organizations
- Open Source: part of the [Mandate of the new Digital Minister](https://pm.gc.ca/en/mandate-letters/minister-digital-government-mandate-letter)
- Open Source: can be used to attract talent! and benefit from economies of scale
- IT investments: reduce risks to the organization, treating business cases like a hypothesis

--

### Goals

- Get the user _IN_ the development process
- Continuously learn, automate and improve
- Reduce lead time for changes and delivery of services/devices
- Recover faster incidents and errors
- Reduce frequency of incidents and errors
- Align with GC IT Direction

Note:

- GC IT Direction: Policy on Service and Digital, Digital Standards, Digital Strategic Operation Plan
