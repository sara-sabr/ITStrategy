## 3. The IT Strategy

### Premise

> To work effectively in the digital world, you must first accept complexity and uncertainty, for they demand very different approach to carrying out initiatives. A predictable world rewards advanced planning and rigid plan execution. But a complex and uncertain world rewards an empirical cycle of trying, observing, and correcting

Note:

- Many external forces:
  - upcoming TB Policy on Service and Digital
  - GC Digital Operations Strategic Plan
  - OneGC Vision
  - BDM

### Focus of the IT Strategy

_Change the relationship IT has with "The Business"_

- From a **contracting** model one
- To a **partnership** one

Note:

- Contracting: expects business requirements and we deliver on requirements
- Partnership: we are one team trying to solve a problem

--

### What it means

Shared accountability

- Lines of business must understand the costs and risks associated with technology
- IT must be able to keep up with business changes

Note:

- Costs and Risks:
- Keep up with demand: 

--

### How we are **doing** strategy making

In the Open. All are welcome and invited to comment and contribute to the strategies at all times

Customers, private sector partners, other levels of government, or other departments...
