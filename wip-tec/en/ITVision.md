# ESDC's IT Vision

[HDLC](HumanDevelopmentLifeCycle.md) -&gt; [KPIs](IITB_KPIs.md) -&gt; IT Vision -&gt; Guiding Principles -&gt; IT Strategies (roadmap)

The following is ESDC's IT Vision.
It paints a vision of the future of IT within ESDC.
It is **not** time bound, but rather as an ideal state to which ESDC IT needs to strive to get to.
Such state will continuously evolve when new information and knowledge is captured, re-adjusting the vision in the process.

The IT Vision complements the [HDLC](HumanDevelopmentLifeCycle.md) story which is taken from the point of view of the citizen, and the [KPIs](IITB_KPIs.md) which define the performance metrics needed to sustain the HDLC, by providing the point of view of the organization's IT capabilities.

The IT Vision leverages the work done in the [IITB Way Forward](http://dialogue/grp/IITB-DGIIT-Gov-New-Nouveau/Documents/Departmental%20IMIT%20Plan/19-20%20Plans/IITB%20Moving%20Forward%20v2.docx), ensures alignment with [IITB's high level priorities](http://esdc.prv/en/iitb/corporate/Who_We_Are/Plans_and_Priorities/index.shtml), and brings the [GC's Digital Operations Strategic Plan 2018-2022](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-operations-strategic-plan-2018-2022.html) into ESDC's operational context.

The ESDC IT Vision is explained using the [GC's Digital Operations Strategic Plan 2018-2022](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-operations-strategic-plan-2018-2022.html) six chapters:

- [1. User-centred, service orientation](#1-User-centred-service-orientation)
- [2. An open, collaborative, and accessible government](#2-An-open-collaborative-and-accessible-government)
- [3. Digital-first and digitally enabled by design](#3-Digital-first-and-digitally-enabled-by-design)
- [4. Modern tech, technology practices and information stewardship](#4-Modern-tech-technology-practices-and-information-stewardship)
- [5. A digitally enabled public service](#5-A-digitally-enabled-public-service)
- [6. Good digital governance](#6-Good-digital-governance)

## 1. User-centred, service orientation

Human Interfaces that citizens interact with (e.g.: websites, web applications, and mobile applications) are rarely provided by ESDC.
Instead, **ESDC must not compete with the private sector** and seeks to leverage it to drastically improve citizen's user experience as well as [promoting Canadian innovation and skills](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-operations-strategic-plan-2018-2022.html).
ESDC makes use of the public and private industries such as job promoting websites, banks, academic institutions, and employers, to offer its services via APIs (see [An open, collaborative, and accessible government](#an-open-collaborative-and-accessible-government)).
ESDC establishes terms of service and conditions with private industries to assure its services are always equitable, [accessible](https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/bill/C-81/royal-assent), do not have barriers for users with disabilities and respect [privacy](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/).
ESDC contributes to the [OneGC vision](https://gccollab.ca/groups/profile/154708/enonegc-ungcfrungc) by leveraging [Government of Canada's single online window](https://open.canada.ca/en/content/service-strategy-overview) instead of creating its own, removing the burden on the citizen to understand how the Government of Canada is internally administered via its multiple departments.

Artificial Intelligence is being used to drastically **[reduce toil](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/eliminating-toil/)**, greatly improving ESDC's commitment to citizens through its continuously improving service standards, enabling auto-enrolment by design, providing insights for service innovation, while ensuring ethical use of [automated decision-making](https://tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32592).
Artificial Intelligence is a shared expertise between the Chief Information Officer (CIO), responsible for the technology infrastructure hosting AI software, and the Chief Data Officer (CDO), responsible for data sciences.

All of ESDC's services are connected and interoperable to enable the **"tell us once"** goal.
All of ESDC's services use a single account, tied to a single identity, in order to avoid multiple separate logins and use **[modern identity verification](https://gcn.com/articles/2019/03/25/mobile-verification.aspx)** to drastically improve identity theft protection for citizens.

## 2. An open, collaborative, and accessible government

The principles of open by default and inclusive by design are integrated into all new processes, systems, solutions, and services.

ESDC **publishes a large majority of its source code under an open source licence**, on the Internet, and seeks contribution from other departments, other jurisdictions, and the public.
Only on exceptional, well documented and justified cases, is source code not published.
By releasing its source code under an open source licence as well as its data under the open government licence, **ESDC's IT community is not restrained to ESDC staff only** and increases its opportunities to identify talent outside of the government.
ESDC leverages crowd sourcing by including other departments, other jurisdictions, and the public to contribute back to its IT solutions.
This [promotes canadian economic growth, skills development in Canada](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-the-essentials-for-canadas-digital-economy/), and improves trusts with canadians as well as greatly increasing ESDC's IT expertise from such broad community relationships.

ESDC **publishes a large majority of the data it uses to make its decisions as open data sets under the Open Government Licence**, promoting transparency and trusts with citizens, and enabling the broader public to make use of government data for developing tools and products that contribute to their well-being and economic growth.
This does not mean publishing sensitive data.
Only on exceptional, well documented and justified cases, is data not published as open data.

ESDC's policy and program development are done "in the open", over the Internet, enabling active participation with stakeholders whether they be citizens, 3rd party partners like banks, employers, or other jurisdictions.

Following the [Directive on Management of IT](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15249), technology choices **adopt open standards with preference for Open Source solutions** in order to avoid vendor lock-in, enable interoperability, and collaboration.
Technology choices does not take a simple look as "COTS *or* Custom", rather choices look at fit for purpose which means "COTS *and* Custom": COTS for commodities and Custom for specialization.
COTS is defined as per [US DoD FAQ](https://dodcio.defense.gov/Open-Source-Software-FAQ/#Q:_Is_open_source_software_commercial_software.3F_Is_it_COTS.3F)

**Business Rules are seen as institutional knowledge** and are managed [internally by ESDC's staff](https://18f.gsa.gov/2018/10/09/implementing-rules-without-rules-engines/), outside of proprietary systems to avoid vendor lock-in and assure long term sustainability of Canadians core benefits systems.

## 3. Digital-first and digitally enabled by design

All of [ESDC's services](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/portfolio/service-canada/programs.html) are delivered through technology with a large majority running on the public cloud to seek benefits of [rapid elasticity, broad internet access, and up to date security patching](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-145).
This includes up to Protected B data.
Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) delivery [cloud models are preferred](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/modern-emerging-technologies/cloud-services/government-canada-cloud-adoption-strategy.html), leaving Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) on exception basis only.

ESDC's IT Solutions can only "talk" to each other via **APIs** allowing channel-agnostic services and communications.
ESDC's APIs are all published on the Government of Canada's **API Store**, enabling the private industry and the public to build mobile applications, websites, applications, and voice assistant compatibility devices, to deliver a variety of user experiences to citizens.

ESDC's IT solutions provide the flexibility needed to empower end-users with the choice of sharing personal data, bringing any privacy concerns in the hands of the end-user as opposed to ESDC making decisions for them.

ESDC prefers **open source software** and products that adopt **open standards** over proprietary ones.
The adoption of Open source software is the main vendor locking mitigation strategy.
The adoption of open standards is the main interoperability enabler strategy.

Legacy technologies like mainframe COBOL have been replaced by implementing [the strangler pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/strangler) as opposed to a big bang one.
The transition of legacy systems into modern ones required large investments on the business and data side, as opposed to IT, in order to accurately depict business rules and processes agnostically of IT systems.

ESDC's legacy core systems are modernized into a set of micro services as opposed to monolithic systems, each working together as an aggregate to bring Pension, Employment Insurance, and Old Age Security delivery to citizens.
The number of services (or number of systems) is not a concern, the concern is rather the ability to effectively manage technical debt and keep up with demands by making timely, small iterative changes.

ESDC leverages different networks based on its need.
The Internet for its most common day to day use, reducing bottleneck to its corporate and production network.
The corporate network for accessing corporate systems (e.g.: HR, Finance, and emails), and production network for accessing the systems hosting Canadians' data and proving services to Canadians.

The CIO is seen as a critical partner in service design and delivery, having a seat at the table as much as the Chief Data Office (CDO) and the Service's strategic direction.
IT's credibility to deliver has been achieved by automating much of its internal development processes when it adopted DevOps.

## 4. Modern tech, technology practices and information stewardship

IT's innovation is focused on solving ESDC's business problems.
Technologies are experimented with to solve business problems, improving the relationships between IT and Service personnel.
All of ESDC's IT innovation is released as open source on the Internet to provide its benefits to other federal departments, jurisdictions, and the public.

ESDC enables and promotes innovation in order to keep up with the fast pace of technology changes.
This is achieved by:

- leveraging bi-modal governance to allow for 2 modes of processes to co-exists in order to simultaneously mitigate risk for production and critical systems while promote experimentation and innovation
- providing stable funding to manage support and infrastructure for innovators
- having well defined processes to provide support in scaling successful experiments into production
- supporting innovation in the organization, using metrics focusing on business objectives, improved pace, and success rates
- inspiring a culture of innovation to its employees 

ESDC is narrowing its technology standards focus on ERP, corporate products allowing economies of scale, and production technology stacks for custom built applications only.
Only on exceptional cases are other technology standardized (e.g.: source code version control).
Product teams manage their own development and testing tools, as well as experimenting with new technology stacks.

Cyber security has shifted to not only include pre-emptive measures but also invest in resilience capabilities.
IT solutions managing citizen data are built with a [zero trust architecture](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/zero-trust-networks/9781491962183/ch01.html).
ESDC's Cyber security has shifted to protecting data at the source and in transit, instead of relying on perimeter defences.
This involves encrypting data at rest, in transit, and relying on strong authentication, access policies, and modern identity verification to govern access to sensitive data.
[Behavioral Analytics and biometrics](https://gcn.com/articles/2019/03/25/mobile-verification.aspx) are necessary to secure access to systems and protect citizens from identity theft.
The [Pan-Canadian Trust Framework](https://canada-ca.github.io/PCTF-CCP/overview/pctf-overview.html) is applied for ESDC's services to enable trusted digital identity to be shared and validated between canadian jurisdictions.

Cyber security is involved from the beginning of IT solution building to the end, and relies on as much automated testing as possible to provide assurance, as opposed to gate-based assessment processes, and relies on embedded knowledge within development teams instead of analysts.

Cyber security manages risks differently depending on which network particular work is being done (production, corporate network, or the Internet) in order to focus efforts more effectively and not hinder operations or innovation.

IT at ESDC adopts modern and agile approaches to development to enable greater adaptability to evolutions in both business requirements and enabling technologies.
IT solution changes are delivered to production within four months, at most, of a change request.
ESDC will move towards a micro-services pattern when delivering IT solutions, allowing for greater interoperability and smaller, cheaper, more rapid changes.
Only through well justified and documented exceptions will IT solutions be allowed to remain as a monolith system.

## 5. A digitally enabled public service

SaaS collaboration tools are [opened by default](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32588&section=html) and only on rare occasions, with sound justifications, are they blocked.
Monitoring of web services is risk managed to focus efforts where risks are perceived and impacts are high.
If monitoring is required, automation is leveraged through a combination of technologies and disciplines, such Artificial Intelligence.

ESDC staff is highly connected and mobile.
This includes service canada representatives that can answer citizen requests from anywhere, anytime (when AI disciplines cannot complete the request).
For various roles at ESDC one does not necessarily require government managed devices.
ESDC staff are allowed to bring their own device to perform their work and, should they chose not to or cannot afford one, are provided with a managed mobile device.
Cyber Security is built-in ESDC's systems so that whether it be an unmanaged device or a managed one that connects to its systems, the assurance level sought is not tied to the device connecting to ESDC's networks but rather to ESDC's cyber security posture and resilience.

Information records have changed to data which is more granular and continually changing.
Document-level records management systems are obsolete, replaced by version control at the data and information level.
Efficient digital processes have rendered paper records obsolete.
This means:

- Briefing notes are digitized
- Corporate services, such as HR and Finance, do not require ESDC staff to provide information on their first day of work as the hiring process already have that information

Instead the information used by ESDC's staff is presented online via a User Experience that seamlessly integrates the combination of data from multiple sources.

ESDC, in partnership with the union, has changed IT talent management for the federal government to improve recruitment, retention of talent, and wellbeing by:

- allowing experienced and valuable CS personnel to reach a salary bracket reflective of their worth, up to CS-05 level, without requiring to move into management or advisory role (e.g.: expert coder, data scientist)
- promoting the exchange of personnel between teams
- allocating 20% of time to continuous improvement, as opposed to yearly class-based training
- building in Cyber security into ESDC's continuous improvement, onboarding training, and performance agreements to assure the public that ESDC's staff can be trusted with their information.
- encouraging employees to go on interchange assignments outside the public service (e.g. private sector, academia) to gain new competencies/experiences.

ESDC's IT community's talent revolves around a continuous improvement culture, fostering and supporting an environment for staff to learn new technologies and how they may be applied to their daily work.

ESDC's IT community is diverse to reflect the full breadth of the talent pool.
This is achieved by proactively promoting technology opportunities to under-represented groups.

## 6. Good digital governance

ESDC recognizes upcoming digital leaders by identifying employees that demonstrates leadership qualities, embrace the digital mindsets, can adapt the ever more rapid pace of change, show empathy to end users, and are able to keep pace with technology lingo and concepts.

ESDC is using product management to ensure its services and associated IT solutions are able to manage technical debt, security patching, bug fixes, and feature enhancements rapidly.

ESDC is using agile project management to coordinate large changes across the enterprise where investments are aligned strategically with the direction of the GC-wide enterprise architecture.
Depending on their complexity, Agile projects makes use of a concept phase prior to defining the solution.

Enterprise Architecture and peer reviews (e.g.: Enterprise Architecture Review Boards) are done by specialists in their fields, that can provide advice on technology choices, data management, and cyber security investments decisions.

ESDC is measured against the Digital Performance Measurement Framework and Maturity Model and is continuously improving its maturity level for each of the maturity domains:

- **info-centric**: Understanding the capacity for information to contribute to business value
- **user-centricity**: The ability to design services with users and to place users at the centre of what we do
- **adoption**: Capacity to leverage technology to enable performance outcomes
- **competencies**: Ability to support services and activities with a digital and data-literate staff
- **integration**: Ability to ensure long-lasting change and fully informed decision-making through governance
