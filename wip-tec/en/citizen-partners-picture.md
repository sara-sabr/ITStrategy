## IT Picture - Medium Term

This is a working document to help the IT Strategy team create a picture of what IT will look in the **medium term** for ESDC in line with the organization's [Vision](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/news/2018/01/backgrounder_oldagesecurityoasautomaticenrolment.html).

In the following sections, we're trying to take the perspectives of different audiences and look at what our strategies will have done to the way ESDC offers its services and operates.

1. **The Citizen**: their experience with ESDC due to adoption of technology in ESDC service delivery
2. **Private Sector**: their relationship with ESDC in partnering with ESDC to improve service delivery

### Citizen

TODO: Some risks are identified towards services to citizens [here](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/reports/departmental-plan/2018-2019/mandate-role-operating-context-risks.html#h2.3)

#### Service performance improvements

In line with ESDC's Vision to modernize its services to Canadians (e.g.: Service Transformation Plan, Workforce Transformation Plan and Benefit Delivery Modernization activities), the technological changes made to ESDC will offer Citizens services performance improvements:

- Reduction in 1-800 O-Canada calls due to an increase of online inquires (via well-managed information that is easy discoverable, multiple digital channels to consume the information, and different means to interact with ESDC such as chatbots)
- Significant reduction of in-person applications and in-person information requests due to improved accessibility and experience of online services
- Increased in web visit traffic due to citizens being more comfortable with technology and preferring using the web to seek information than phone or in-person visits
- Increased online applications for employer benefits
- Massively reduced amount of postal mail applications (except passport issuance) as old age pension, pension-related payments and earnings, and grants and loans are delivered digitally through registered banking institutions; at the preference of the citizen
- Near zero fax applications
- Beginning of online confirmation/validation of Government of Canada mandated credentials (e.g. SIN) as opposed to in-person or mail, due to the launch and adoption of trusted digital identities with Sign-in Canada.

Technology in services is seeing constant improvements in terms of stability, with fewer service outages and shorter wait times, as ESDC's IT infrastructure is being modernized, the Benefits Delivery Modernization (BDM) agile project has made significant iterations over 5 years, and ESDC's Transformation agenda is well underway.

#### Service Experience Improvements

Technology is being used to improve service experience for the citizen.
Through technology, citizens are offered improved user experiences as identified in ESDC's [Service Transformation Agenda](http://esdc.prv/en/department/service-strategy/corner/transformation-agenda/index.shtml).
Such experiences resulting from increased use of technology include:

- Options to use different channels to obtain services or assistance.
These channels may be ESDC's website, the beginning of the GC services portal, Service Canada centres, video chat kiosks, or 3rd party trusted providers acting as intermediaries (e.g. job searching on other platforms than JobBank, mobile applications developed by the industry)
- Not being asked twice for the same information ("Tell us once") is achieved while complying with the Privacy Act as technology enables citizens to keep ownership and choose when to share their personal information
- Have access to most services wherever they are, anytime of day
- Being automatically enrolled to receive benefits without having to apply
- Automated administrative services like pre-filled applications and program auto-enrollment to save the time it takes to fill out forms and research programs
- Centralized login for main ESDC services, leveraging existing citizen identities from provincial, territorial, federal and private sector organizations following the [Pan-Canadian Trust Framework](https://canada-ca.github.io/PCTF-CCP/).
- Stronger integration of ESDC and CRA services and the launch of the GC Services Portal.
- Pages with scrollable instructions outlining details of the application process are a relic of the past.

This is inline the OneGC vision, that includes "Tell us once", "Sign-in Canada" and the services portal, presented in the [GC Digital Operation Strategic Plan 2018-2022](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-operations-strategic-plan-2018-2022.html#ToC15).

#### Service Centres and Outreach

- Service Canada agents focus on interacting through outreach by default, leading to more personalized service, closer to the needs of clients and increased support and identification of eligible citizens that are isolated or can't access digital services on their own.
- Repetitive processes are handled through automation
- Citizens have the ability to give consent in sharing personal information, allowing personal data to be shared across program services (even if such programs fall outside of ESDC's mandate)

TODO: use the list of major projects as input to describe the business outcomes for citizens (e.g. central login, service improvement)

### External Partners

- By External Partners, we mean for profit companies, not for profit organizations, academia, private citizens and other jurisdictions such as provinces, cities, schools, etc.

#### Any platform, any device, 3rd party integration

- External partners are strongly encouraged to innovate using ESDC APIs published on the GC Open [API Store](https://api.canada.ca/) and ESDC's datasets published on the [Open Government Portal](https://open.canada.ca/en)
- They are able to view some of the source code that is being used to run their automated services, as ESDC started publishing their source code under open source licences and working in the open
- ESDC provides the ability, for some services, for citizens to be able to see who, when, and why, organizations viewed their information
- Transparency, accountability, and monitoring is built into all automated processes.
External partners are respecting citizens' privacy when they use ESDC's services (i.e. no data mining or selling).

#### Open Collaboration

ESDC's culture is embracing openness and transparency, understanding that ESDC acts as the steward of the data, not the owner.
The citizen is the owner of the data.
As such ESDC:

- has established a mature Data Strategy that assures sound governance, privacy by design, trusted source of truths, and transparency in the way ESDC manages citizen data
- actively promotes and enables across all branches the publishing of open datasets, seeking feedback from External Partners on the usefulness of datasets, its quality, and the ones that should have higher priority for publication
- actively works to desensitize datasets that may contain sensitive information (such as aggregate information)
- actively encourages small businesses and other jurisdiction partners to innovate using ESDC's APIs published on the GC API Store

Because ESDC publishes all new custom software code under an open source licence, it leverages External Partners contribution to more rapidly get feedback, apply corrections, and contribute back to the open source community.
The [Open Resource Exchange](https://canada-ca.github.io/ore-ero/en/index.html) is being used.

## IT Picture - Long Term

This is a working document to help the IT Strategy team create a picture of what IT will look in the **long term** for ESDC in line with the organization's [Vision](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/news/2018/01/backgrounder_oldagesecurityoasautomaticenrolment.html).

In the following sections, we're trying to take the perspectives of different audiences and look at what our strategies will have done to the way ESDC offers its services and operates.

1. **The Citizen**: their experience with ESDC due to adoption of technology in ESDC service delivery
2. **Private Sector**: their relationship with ESDC in partnering with ESDC to improve service delivery

  - [Self-Service](#self-service)
  - [Service Centres and Outreach](#service-centres-and-outreach)
- [External Partners](#external-partners)

  - [Open Collaboration](#open-collaboration)

### Citizen

- Citizens receive their services through automated processes through their preferred services.
- Generational change: Citizens are used to deal with technologies, they do not face technical illiteracy like 2019.
- OneGC: Citizens interact with federal government services, without having to understand how those are administered by multiple departments.
That interaction is either via a central GC Portal or via 3rd-party providers like banks, employers, provincial services.

#### Automatic Enrollment and Delivery

Enrollment and delivery of services is automated by default and wherever possible, with an opt-out option.

Canadians who do not opt out benefit seamlessly from GC services.
For example from their:

- Bank(s)
- Preferred job hunting website
- Preferred social media platform(s)
- IoT devices

90% of citizens (33 300 000 people) (TO-DO: Validate this number) have a trusted Canadian profile used to verify/validate identity via the [Pan-Canadian Trust Framework](https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/).

Citizens can receive their benefits seamlessly throughout their lives as major life events trigger the delivery of benefits.
See the [Human Development Lifecycle (HDLC)](/human-development-life-cycle.html).

#### Self-Service

The GC (OneGC) Portal provides access to services and benefits (not just ESDC) in a tell us once fashion, as presented in the [GC Digital Operations Strategic Plan: 2018-2022](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-operations-strategic-plan-2018-2022.html).

Registering to the Portal will create or use the trusted Canadian profile and enable automatic enrollment and delivery of eligible benefits.
Help for using the Portal is available directly on the Portal using instant messaging (text, voice or video) as well as by phone.
Results in easier access to services through delivering services to the client through hands-off automated processes or supplemented by staff if required.

#### Service Centres and Outreach

For the 10% not enrolled automatically and unable to use the GC Portal (3 700 000 people) other options are provided.
Costs saved through reduced real estate and increased automation have helped ESDC to offer greater, more accessible and personalized services for citizens that are isolated and can't benefit directly from the digital services.
In this way, through a reduced reliance on physical real estate, ESDC is better able to service regions in need.

TODO: 10% needs to be validated/sourced

1. Government of Canada Kiosks will be made available at community hubs (For example, malls or banks)
2. Service representatives are available to:

- Help citizens register and use digital services
- Use digital services on behalf of clients (there are no separate 'admin service functions' required for registration)

### External Partners

- By External Partners, we mean for profit companies, not for profit organizations, academia, private citizens and other jurisdictions.
- Through leveraging the government endpoints the private sector is able to offer the opt-in delivery and integration of government services into their offerings (taking into account this is complimented by the government provided alternate methods of service delivery)
- As GC departments and agencies are working in the open, private sector is able to comment on, request, and offer improvements of, GC software and services.

#### Any platform, any device, 3rd party integration

Any platform or device can be integrated with GC and ESDC services.
Development is often done in partnership with the private sector (working in the open).
This is possible because ESDC services are available as APIs that can be used by third party platforms and services (Banks, CRA, Social media, Job boards, Internet of things, ..).
Employers, Banks, and Credit Unions are the new front lines of ESDC as they are now provided with technological means to interact with ESDC services.

Ecosystem of services are created by leveraging private sector expertise where opportunities exist (win-win public-private partnerships), e.g.:

- Banks detecting missed paycheck, job websites targeting people who are job hunting...
- Enhanced security through integration in private sector service (e.g., banks detecting fraudulent transactions)

User privacy must still be preserved and modern digital identity recognition technologies are leveraged (e.g. facial, biometrics).
Clients control their private data and have the ability to decide, for each service, whether to share it or not to influence their user experience.

#### Open Collaboration

- ESDC custom-built software is published as open source code by allowing the private sector to use them and study them, which helps grow technological skill sets and increases collaboration throughout the country, fostering economic growth, improving transparency and trust in government, and increasing the breadth of talent for ESDC to use by welcoming contributions back.
- ESDC is able to use open source contributions to its projects as a hiring tool, given that candidates would have already demonstrated technical ability, and familiarity with the code base, reducing training costs.
  - These are listed on the [Open Resource Exchange](https://canada-ca.github.io/ore-ero/en/index.html) that lists open source software used and published by Canadian public administrations.
- ESDC data (performance and automated decision-making statistics) published as open datasets on the [Open Government Portal](https://open.canada.ca/en/).
