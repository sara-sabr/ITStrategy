# Trial of a Fully Mobile Worker Profile

## Replacing desks with mobile phones

The IT Strategy team is proposing that they act as testers for fully mobile workers. Presently, the team is working using modern tools in adherence with PANDU update (list TBS initiatives and IT PIN). Due to the nature of our work, we interact with minimal to no protected data. As a result, this allows the team to leverage modern openly accessible solutions, viewable by the Canadians who pay for our work. In order to ensure that we maintain access to internal tooling, such as Skype for Business and our internal e-mails, which can be accessed through mobile devices. If mobile phones are made available to the IT Strategy team, the team would no longer need a physical work location, a practice which, if extended, could greatly save on costs for the department, especially given the current space constraints the department is facing. If this model proves effective, it could be expanded to other works who have similar functions which do not require frequent, or any, access to protected information. Further, going forward, as the cloud becomes ever more ubiquitous, and increasing number of functions will fall into this category of work -- those who are able to work in a complete remote manner. Given the teams experience with open and collaborative tools, we have the expertise and background to trail this program in order to save ESDC on space and retail costs going forward.
