### Creation of Umbrella Fund 

#### Vision

New processes created through a lean approach to product management through this fund will be leveraged to drastically increase the efficiency of ESDC's IT services  

#### Mission

The umbrella fund is to provide self managed funding for the IT Strategy team with the intent of trialing new ways of working for approving more rapidly software and hardware onboarding. These trials will work with the right stakeholders to identify unnecessary processes and to automate as much as possible the ones that are necessary.

#### Implementation 

##### Onboarding 

Through collaboration with the existing Innovation Hub, onboard new projects and ideas from the business lines 

##### Funding 

*Option 1*

Engage Innovation Hub about possible funding avenues 

*Option 2*

1. Engage business lines about available funding how highly desired, or high priority, functions 
2. Engage business lines to provide $X/year in a determined cost centre that will act as the umbrella fund pot

*Option 3*

Leverage existing IITB available funds

*Option 4*

Submit a TB Sub for funds 

##### Development

ESDC's R&D team (and other opt-in ESDC development teams) will turn the business request into PoCs on fully PoCs on self-managed cloud instances, with the source code published under an open source licence, funded by the Umbrella Fund 

##### Approval 

The business through the Innovation Lab will approve and sponsor the project. 

##### Transition 

The project will be proposed to IITB for development. If IITB is unable or unwilling, through possibly leveraging (more information needed here) available ISED programs, give the open source project to small to medium size businesses to bring the product to fruition
