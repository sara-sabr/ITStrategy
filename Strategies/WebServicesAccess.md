## Enabling Access to Web Services and Tool at ESDC

### Purpose

To seek approval and endorsement for IITB to enable open by default access to the Internet for all ESDC employees, including instant messaging, video conferencing, cloud storage and other collaboration tools available online.

### Background

The recent [Direction on Enabling Access to Web Services: Policy Implementation Notice (PIN)](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32588) provides direction to departments on enabling access to web services, in accordance with the [Policy on Acceptable Network and Device Use (PANDU)](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27122). The scope of this direction applies to GC electronic networks for unclassified information.

> Departments are to enable open access to the Internet for GC electronic networks and devices, including GC and external Web 2.0 tools and services that enhance productivity, communication and collaboration, in accordance with the [Policy on Government Security](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16578), to individuals working with the GC, including employees of the federal government as well as casuals, contractors, students and other persons who have been authorized by the deputy head to access Government of Canada electronic networks and devices.

> Departments are to reconfigure their web filtering rules to be open by default to the Internet, except for websites that support non-acceptable activities or behaviours. See [Categories to be blocked](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32588#appA). All other categories, including social media and web-based collaboration or chat tools, are to be open by default.

### Issue

Sites that are classified as instant messaging, video conferencing, cloud storage and other online collaboration tools are blocked for ESDC employees on the network. This blacklist can never be complete and in some case seem to prefer certain solutions over others. See list of [Sites that are blocked and not blocked](#sites-that-are-blocked-and-not-blocked).

### Considerations

More open access to the Internet will assist ESDC employees to conduct the business of the department more efficiently and effectively.
It will support the digital transformation of how public servants work and serve Canadians by enhancing collaboration, augmenting professional development opportunities, encouraging sharing of knowledge to support innovation and helping to create a more open culture.

IITB must adapt to meet the demands and expectations of its clients, stakeholders, partners and employees.
In addition to implementing the changes required by the PIN, it will also align the department with the [GC Digital Standards](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html) by empowering staff to deliver better services and collaborate widely while also enabling them to work in the open.
When access to collaboration tools and sites is restricted, instead of increasing protection, the opposite occurs.
Users will find a way around the blocks if it makes their life easier.
Security is more than just locking things down; user experience must also be considered.

Instead of banning access to certain tools and sites, making access open by default and encouraging the secure use will result in risks being better controlled.
Informing users of expected behaviours when using the Internet will help them to protect against potential confidentiality or privacy breaches and to comply with existing ESDC and GC codes of conduct and policies.

## Next Steps

Should you approve, the Strategy team will work with Security and others at IITB to make access to the Internet open by default at ESDC and to ensure training opportunities are available regarding the classification of information and the acceptable use of external cloud services and tools.
