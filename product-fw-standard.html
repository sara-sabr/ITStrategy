<div class="alert alert-warning">
    <p align="center"><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong></p>
    <p>
This document <strong>does NOT</strong> attempt to explain all aspects of Product Management (such as vision setting, user research, and the different phases a product goes through in its life cycle).
These are well documented already, such as on <a href="https://www.pmi.org/disciplined-agile/process/product-management">PMI.org</a> and <a href="https://community.pdma.org/knowledgehub/home">PDMA.org</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Instead, this documents seeks to provide structure to ESDC Programs and IITB in the <strong>transition</strong> from project to product, <strong>within a Canadian federal government context</strong>.
    In particular, the methods to <strong>fund cross-functional and cross-branch product teams</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Directive and Standard strive to be as succinct and to the point as possible, without repeating rules in existing policy instruments that teams are expected to comply with (such as Financial and Security). To help the reader understand the rationale behind them and provide guidance in implementing them, <a href="/ITStrategy/product-fw-guidance.html">a Guidance document has been written</a>.

<h3 id="product-team-setup">Product Team Setup</h3>

<h4 id="software-development-work">Software Development Work</h4>

<p>Budgeting a cross-branch product team will require the Sponsoring Branch to also budget part of the IT work that can be directly attributed to the product. Indirect costs such as SSC hosting services are not included as they are pooled at the IITB level.</p>

<p>Software Development work that a Sponsoring Branch budgets includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Software development labour (non salary and salary)</li>
  <li>Operating and managing labour (e.g. software bug fixes, patching, incident response). This budget depends on the operating support hours</li>
  <li>Public Cloud credits (if using public cloud services such as MS Azure to host software or use cloud providers software as a service)</li>
  <li>Software licences specific to the product team’s (e.g. a specialized proprietary software that the product team will purchase)</li>
  <li>Any specialize equipment, such as high performing laptops</li>
</ul>

<p>It is worth noting that indirect IT costs, such as relational databases, SSC virtual machines, IITB corporate services such as Document Upload, do not make up the software development work budget.</p>

<h4 id="release-impact-analysis">Release Impact Analysis</h4>

<p>At every release, the Product Team does a retrospection after an adequate amount of time has passed to analyse the impact of that release towards its desired outcome(s).
The retrospection includes the following information:</p>

<h4 id="product-teams-software-performance-metrics">Product Team’s Software Performance Metrics</h4>

<p>The following software performance metrics are produced by the product team to measure the effectiveness that working under a cross-functional product team has over continuous product improvements.
In particular, that the Product Manager and Product Owner take sufficient attention on the risks that creeping technical debt, team morale, and cyber security has on the overall quality and effectiveness of the product team.</p>

<p>The metrics are compiled and made available each month.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Deployment Frequency</strong>: How often the product team successfully releases to production</li>
  <li><strong>Lead Time for Changes</strong>: The amount of time it takes a code commit to get into production (software pipeline delivery)</li>
  <li><strong>Change Failure Rate</strong>: The percentage of deployments causing a failure in production</li>
  <li><strong>Time to Restore Service</strong>: How long it takes the product team to recover from a failure in production</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="risk-register">Risk Register</h4>

<p>A risk and issue register is a document that documents risks related to the product(s) and the mitigation plan for each.
When a risk materializes, it changes itself into an issue that needs to be resolved.</p>

<p>The Risk Register may be used as evidence that risk management is being performed by the product team.
The Risk Register is available to auditors on demand.</p>

<p>Each risks in the register contains, at minimum, the following element:</p>

<p>The Product’s Risk Register does not repeat risks from a Branch Risk Register (BRR) or the IT Security Risk Register (that rolls up to the BRR).
Instead, the Product’s Risk Register is to manage risks at the product level.
Its content may be used to inform the grater BRR and IT Security Risk Register by rolling up multiple products’ risk registers.</p>
