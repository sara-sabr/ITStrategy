  <li><a href="#inventory-of-known-definitions-of-product">Inventory of known definitions of “Product”</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This document seeks to clarify what will be the definition of “Product” for ESDC.</p>

<p>A clear definition, accepted by both “IT” and “The Business”, is necessary to set the right expectations, reduce confusion, and ensure alignment of efforts.</p>

<h2 id="esdc-definition-of-product">ESDC Definition of “Product”</h2>

<p>3 reasons why there needs to be an IT “hook” in the definition:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32603">Policy on service and digital</a> requires departmental integrated plans to <a href="https://gcconnex.gc.ca/discussion/view/72865810/dpsd-guide-1-0-for-integrated-planning-guide-pmsn-1-0-pour-le-plan-integre?language=en">identify the apps in the APM portfolio that are being invested in</a>. APM is already an established methodology with TBS.</li>
  <li>Software has a unique characteristic: it’s elastic (this is what Cloud gives us). The marginal costs of changing software is low and warrants adjusting our planning methods.</li>
  <li>If the definition is too BROAD, it is meaningless. To mean something for IT, it needs to have a technology meaning.</li>
</ol>

<p>The IT Strategy’s Product Management Strategy proposal considers the above three points. If those change, its proposal may not be relevant.</p>

<p>May consider using a different term like “Digital Product”…</p>

        A product is a tangible or intangible output that is the result of a process that does not include activities that are performed at the interface between the supplier (provider) and the customer.<br /><br />Products can be tangible or intangible. According to a note to this definition, there are three generic product categories - hardware, processed materials, and software. Many products combine several of these categories. For example, an automobile (a product) combines hardware (e.g. tires), software (e.g. engine control algorithms), and processed materials (e.g. lubricants).

        A product is generally viewed as an item, tangible or virtual, that is developed through a process and provides value to stakeholders and the market.<br /><br />Do not expect a universal definition of a product. Everyone will have a different understanding of what a product is and will structure people, processes, and technologies according to that interpretation. Misunderstanding of product definitions within business and IT teams can lead to further confusion behind the rationale of product roadmaps.<br /><br />Products are necessities for the continuing performance of business functions. Efficient delivery practices and effective product management and planning are inevitable as the business and technologies constantly evolve and change. <br /><br />However, good product delivery and management practices are often an afterthought because these capabilities are viewed as low priority and embedded within other roles and responsibilities. Many organizations already adopting agile development lack core product practices that are foundational in this transition.
